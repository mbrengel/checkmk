Synchronizing configurations between the central and remote sites has taken too
much time in the past because the entire configuration was always synchronized.
Even files that are still present on the remote site were completely
synchronized, which led to increased computing effort, traffic and runtime.

This mechanism has now been replaced by an incremental mechanism. Before each
synchronization, the system determines which files already exist on the remote
site. Only those files are synchronized that differ from the central site.

Note that for migration purposes, remote sites should be upgraded before the
central site is upgraded. It is not supported to run a set-up in which the
central site runs on a newer Checkmk version than the remote sites. See werk
#13313 for more information.
