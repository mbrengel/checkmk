Title: MySQL: The MySQL Plugin now supports multiple instances
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1

For this new feature it was needed to pass the information about the used instance to the checks. Cause of this
a re discovery is needed for all MySQL Hosts. Sorry for that.
