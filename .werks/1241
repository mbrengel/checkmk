Title: hp_prolaint: Unkown state is not longer handled as OK
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Due to a bug in the HP Firmware there was a need to handle a reported uknown state as {OK}.
Since HP provided an Firmware update (http://h20566.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=c03939085&jump) we can 
handle this state now like expected.
