Title: cisco_mem_asa: Special memory check for cisco asa devices.
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1436357191
Class: fix

The normal cisco_memory check now ignores Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances because of a bug in the firmware:

Instead, this check will appear. The name wont change and you don't loose any history, but a re discovery is needed.
This check only ignores the MEMPOOL_GLOBAL_SHARED pool.
