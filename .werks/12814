Title: agent_aws(<tt>aws_ebs_limits</tt>): do not request public snapshots from marketplace

Class: fix

In previous versions the check <tt>aws_ebs_limits</tt> reported a wrong snapshot number,
because even snapshots from the AWS marketplace were requested.
This werk fixes the check <tt>aws_ebs_limits</tt> by appling a filter to the snapshot request.

Furthermore, this fix also decreases the runtime of the agent, since considerably less snapshots are requested.

In order to be able to monitor snapshots the "create volume permissions"
are required for the monitoring AWS account.
