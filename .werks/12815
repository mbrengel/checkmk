The agent plugin mk_oracle does not create a cache file any more in case of error.
In previous versions the content of the cache file could contain an error message like:
"Error Message:          ABC|FAILURE|ERROR:ORA-01017: invalid username/password;..."
You have to redeploy the agent plugin in order to apply this bugfix.
