If you used the inpage search on the "Setup" - "Hosts" page and searched for
pattern that matched other columns as "Hostname", e.g. "Monitored on site", all
bulk operations on found hosts showed the error "Please select some hosts
before doing bulk operations on hosts", even if checkboxes were selected.
