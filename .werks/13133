On rare occasions, a Checkmk automation call invoked by the GUI could
freeze while waiting for the underlying process to terminate.

While this holds true for all automation calls issued by the Checkmk
GUI, this mainly affects background jobs with underlying automation calls,
e.g., an agent baking job. As a consequence, the affected backgound jobs had
to be terminated manually by their PID.

This behavior only occured for processes that yield a very long output, and could
only be observed on a few individual Checkmk installations.
