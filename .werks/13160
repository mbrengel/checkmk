In the previous version, the REST API asked the user to provide
the key_id parameter for agent related endpoints in order to sign
the agents. This was not possible as the key_id is only used internally.
This werk, therefore, changes the key_id requirement to the key fingerprint
which can be queried through another endpoint and is also visible in WATO.
