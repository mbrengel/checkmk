Title: oracle_asm_diskgroup: fixed wrong calculation of free space in NORMAL/HIGH redundancy Disk Groups

Class: fix

The total and free space is calculated on the redundancy of the Disk Group. The
calculation is complicated when a Disk Group has more then the required number
of Failure Groups. The check expects 2 for NORMAL and 3 for HIGH redundancy
without and 3 or 5 with voting files.
The size of every Failure Group of a Disk Group must be the same, which is a
recommendation from Oracle. Otherwise the calculation is wrong.

The expected number of Failure Groups for a Disk Groups is the default for
nearly every Oracle installation.

This fix changes nothing when EXTERNAL redundancy is used.
