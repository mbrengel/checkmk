Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

An Oracle Database is normaly running as PRIMARY in OPEN mode.
This is not the case in very rare configurations and leads to
unwanted CRITICAL states.
The OPEN mode can now be configured and the default is CRITICAL
when a PRIMARY is not open.
