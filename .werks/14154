In configurations with more than 10 remote sites, each with at least 1000 services,
there were problems in displaying the data in a timely manner. Sometimes views took more than 30 seconds to open.
This werk optimises a socket timeout to improve overall performance. 
The sorting algorithm for some tables has also been improved, halving the sorting time.

This is just a preliminary fix. A complete revision of the mechanics for retrieving data will be available in version 2.1.
