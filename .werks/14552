When upgrading a 1.6.0 site, the configuration data for manual checks (also known as enforced
services or static checks) would only be partially updated.
Specifically, the "<i>Checktype</i>" would not be updated to reflect new plug-in names.
This would result in warnings such as this,

C+:
-| WARNING: Invalid rule configuration detected (Ruleset: static_checks:fileinfo-groups, Title: Size, age and count of file groups, Folder: ,

-| Rule nr: 1, Exception: fileinfo.groups is not an existing element in this selection.)
C-:

during upgrades from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0.
With this werk, the checktype is automatically transformed during the update step.
