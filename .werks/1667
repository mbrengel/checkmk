Title: Sidebar snapin 'Tree of Folders' and 'WATO folder' filter now available on slave sites
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Class: feature
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1

The multisite filter <i>WATO folder</i> was not available on slave sites with disabled WATO.
The <i>Tree of Folders</i> snapin was available even if WATO was disabled.
If you clicked on a link on the <i>Tree of Folders</i> snapin the upcoming page displayed
wrong information because the <i>WATO folder</i> filter was missing.
This has been fixed.

The new behaviour:
<ul>
<li>Slave site:<i>Tree of Folders</i> snapin is always available</li>
<li>Slave site:<i>WATO folder</i> filter is always available</li>
<li>Master site:<i>Tree of Folders</i> snapin is not available if WATO is disabled</li>
<li>Master site:<i>WATO folder</i> filter not available if WATO is disabled</li>
</ul>
