Title: Interface groups: Can create groups out of interface item names
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1421226714
Class: feature

In the previous version a interface group could only get created out of
interfaces which shared the same interface type.

With this update you can now specify grouped interfaces by their type as well
as their item name. Keep in mind that the item name depends on the parameters
<tt>if_inventory_uses_alias</tt> or <tt>if_inventory_uses_description</tt>.
