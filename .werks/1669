This script is only available as source code in the check_mk git repository under
<tt>doc/treasures/check_16bit_program.cc</tt>.
It should be configured as mrpe script in the check_mk.ini.
For example:

<tt>check = Pump_Program C:\test\check_16bit_program.exe petro3003.exe</tt>

On success it returns with exit code 0 and
"{program} is running. Path of executable: {Path of program}"

On failure it returns with exit code 2 and
"{program} not running"

Note: 16 Bit programs in windows are actually not real processes. They are executed
as separate threads in processes named ntvdm.exe.
