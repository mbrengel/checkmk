You are now able to apply already existing logwatch patterns to the messages which
are sent to the Event Console. Each message can be reclassified to a different alert level
and even set to IGNORED, which causes a message not to be sent to the Event Console.
This pre-sorting might reduce the load of the Event Console.

Keep in mind that the logwatch pattern are configured by host and the logfile name.
These restrictions do also apply to the messages intented for the Event Console.
So you can configure a logwatch pattern specifially designed for a message from a certain logfile.

For example, you can reclassify any messages from a logfile <i>access.log</i> containing "C Login error" to
"I Login error". Any message of <i>access.log</i>  containing the "Login error" pattern will therefore get ignored and
not sent to the Event Console.
