The check ibm_svc_license now has configurable license limits via WATO.

Additionally, the limits for all license check got a small change,
thats why this werk is marked as incompatible.


Old limits:
<ul>
<li>Absolute unused levels - Warn/Crit at xx</li>
<li>Percentage unused levels - Warn/Crit at xx</li>
<li>Go critical if all licenses are used</li>
<li>Always report OK</li>
</ul>


New limits:
<ul>
<li>Absolute unused levels - Warn/Crit below xx</li>
<li>Percentage unused levels - Warn/Crit below xx</li>
<li>Go critical if all licenses are used</li>
<li>Always report OK</li>
</ul>

This change has been made because it was hard to configure an OK state
when the used licenses equalled the number of available licenses.
