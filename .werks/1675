Title: esx_vsphere_hostsystem.cpu_util_cluster: Averaged CPU utilization of all cluster nodes
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1422287199
Class: feature

This new check allows you to monitor the average CPU utilization over all cluster nodes.
Each node has informations about the total available MHz and the actually used MHz for computing.
The actual usage of a cluster is calculated by the formula <i>(total_used_mhz / total_avail_mhz) * 100</i>

Via WATO you can configure a set of WARN and CRIT levels for specific node counts.
