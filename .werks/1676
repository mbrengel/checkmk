Title: if.include: now able to detect grouped interfaces
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1422366130
Class: feature

This feature is more developer oriented. There are no changes to any interface checks.

The inventory function in if.include can now automatically create interface groups.
If an interface is in a group you can specify this group in the first field (ifIndex) of the line.
Instead of a simple index, you now put a tuple of (ifGroup, ifIndex).

The inventory function detects if there are multiple interfaces in the same group and creates
a virtual interface out of them. Grouped interfaces are no longer listed separately.
