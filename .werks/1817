When using Nagios (or Icinga) as monitoring core, the "Check_MK" services was always resulting
in an OK state, even when the output reported that it has a critical problem, for example
because of the agent of the monitored host can not be reached.

This bug seem to be existant since Mon, 15 Dec 2014.
