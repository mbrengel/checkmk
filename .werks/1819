The temperature checks for Dell PowerEdge now use a service description that starts with
<tt>Temperature</tt> and a plugin output that is consistent with the other temperature
checks in the system.

Note: since the name of the item has changed you need to reinventorize all these checks.
Also new RRD will be created since the service description has changed.
