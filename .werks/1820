Title: mem.linux: new dedicated check for Linux memory management
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1419857838
Class: feature

The new check {mem.linux} replaces {mem.used} and {mem.vmalloc} for Linux
hosts.  It takes core of almost every aspect of the Linux memory management,
such as page tables, shared memory, overcommitting, disk writeback areas
and much more. It outputs lots of performance data. Depending on the kernel
version and of which memory areas are present you will see up to ten predefined
PNP graphs for a single host!

Please note that this is an incompatible change since the new check's
performance data is not compatible with that one from the superseeded
checks. The new check will be selected as soon as you redo the service
discovery for your Linux hosts.
