Title: oracle_undostat: rule for non space error count
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1420965043
Class: feature

The check oracle_undostat has a new rule for choosing the state when a
'cannot allocate another extent' in the Undo-Tablespace occurs. Oracle
counts this event as non space error count in v$undostat.

In previos versions this leads to a critical state. Now it is possible 
to configure the state with a new rule.
