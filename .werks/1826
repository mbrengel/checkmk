Title: oracle_dataguard_stats: New rule for apply_lag_min, removed default rule
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1420970426
Class: feature

The default parameters for this check has been removed, because there are
no real usable default values for this check. Please add a rule if you used
the default parameters in the past.

A new check has been introduced. The minimum time in seconds for the apply_lag
could be monitored as well. This requires a configured apply_lag in your
Data Guard which is very seldom used.
