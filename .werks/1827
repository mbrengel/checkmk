Title: oracle_tablespace: WATO rule for default increment
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: feature
Compatible: incomp
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1422393240

The WATO rule was lacking a configuration for the default increment on
datafiles.  This has been added.

Importan Note:
The old configuration variable
<tt>oracle_tablespaces_check_default_increment</tt> has been replaced with
the dictionary based parameter <tt>defaultincrement</tt>.  This change does
not modify the default behaviour. However, users who disabled the check for
the default increment need to add a rule with the new dictionary based parameter.
