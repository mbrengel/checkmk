Title: diskstat: detect multipath devices and handle them instead of the physical paths
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1420467168
Class: feature

The Linux <i>Disk IO</i> check now uses the information about the Multipathing
if available and the drops single checks for the various <tt>sd</tt><i>XY</i>
devices of the paths and instead adds checks for the resulting multipath
devices.

That drastically reduces the number of services and displays more useful
information at the same time.
