Title: fileinfo, fileinfo.groups: new parameter for selecting ranges of the time of the day
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1421156140
Class: feature

With this new check parameter you can make the check go critical only during certain
times of the day. That way you can for example say: Between 8:00 and 9:00 this must
exist a certain file, but otherwise it is not neccessary.
