Title: Keep record of original source IP address of a syslog message or SNMP trap

Class: feature

The Event Console now stores the original source IP address when receiving an event
directly via an SNMP trap or the builting syslog server. This ipaddress is put into
a new dedicated field in the event and is shown in the details of the event. In the
event rules you can now match on this address using a X.X.X.X/Y networking syntax.

Note: If you receive syslog messages forwarded from another syslog server, then
you will see the IP address of that server there - not from the original message.
