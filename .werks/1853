Title: cisco_power, cisco_fan, cisco_temp_perf: fixed service description for some special cases

For some Cisco switches the item name of sensors was incorrectly determined
from the snmp oid "ciscoEnvMonSupplyStatusDescr". When the status description
contains "Status is ..." or "PS1 ..." in the second field, this field was
incorrectly included in the item name.

The problem is fixed. Since the item name changes due to this fix, you need to
redo a service discovery.

To our knowledge this problem only affects the cisco_power check. cisco_fan
and cisco_temp_perf may theorectically be affected since the same algorithm
is used, but the status descriptions for these checks are different.

Example:

status description: "Sw1, PS1 Normal, RPS Normal",
old item name: "Sw1 PS1 Normal 3036",
new item name: "Sw1"
