Title: Not showing "only show permitted hosts/services" option for users not having "see all" permissions

This option is only meant to reduce the amount of seen hosts/services of a user having the
"see all hosts/services" permission to the hosts/services which the user is really assigned
to. To configure this option makes only sense for users having the "see all" permissions. Now
WATO only shows the checkboxes for these users.
