Title: cisco_temperature: Replaces cisco_temp_perf and cisco_temp_sensor
Level: 1

This fixes an old issue with certain sensors not being detected on some
Cisco devices.
All services of cisco_temp_perf and cisco_temp_sensor will go unknown,
these hosts will need to be re-inventorized. Rules set to configure
cisco_temp_sensor will no longer apply to cisco_temperature, so these
services will need to be reconfigured.
