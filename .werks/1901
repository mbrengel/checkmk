Title: mk_oracle: IGNORE_DB_NAME for special environments
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427650928
Class: feature

There are very rare environments, where databases use the same DB_NAME on 1 host.
mk_oracle is not able to monitor such environments. This problem has been fixed
with this change.

H2: Important Note
When <tr>IGNORE_DB_NAME=1</tr> is configured in <tr>mk_oracle.cfg</tr> the name
of discovered checks will change from <tr>ORA <Database-Name> <Check></tr> to
<tr>ORA <Instance-Name> <Check></tr>.

The monitoring of Real Application Clusters or Standby Environments is not possible
with this parameter, because the checks don't use name which could be configured as
a clustered service.
