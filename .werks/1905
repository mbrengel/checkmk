Title: oracle_recovery_status: Bugfix for checkpoints in the future
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427882680
Class: fix

The check results in CRITICAL state when the last checkpoint time is in
the futute. This is possible after daylight changes or after a change of
time on the database server after the start of the instance.
This has been corrected. The check leads to a WARNING state when the last
checkpoint is in the future and the time is displayed as a result.
