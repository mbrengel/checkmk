In werk #1563 we moved all parameters for the process check to
a check parameter rule set in normal Check_MK style. Previously
these parameters (like process count, CPU levels, etc.) had been
set only during discovery. Due to this werk existing configurations
with rules for process inventory would not work anymore.

This werk fixes this. All old inventory (now called
discovery) rules work again. Also they are ediable via WATO. Now you can
set the process parameters in two places: during discovery
and in the parameter rule. The preferred way is the new way:
to set them in the parameter rule. That way changes will immediately
get active without a need for a new discovery.
