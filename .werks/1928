Title: netapp_api_if: Improved handling and check output of virtual interfaces

The connection speed of virtual interfaces is now determined correctly.
Per default, the highest speed of all physical interface members is taken.

Please note that this speed depends on how your virtual interfaces are configured.
It is also possible that a virtual interface has the accumulated bandwith of all its physical
interfaces. In this case you need to set a "Assumed interface speed" in WATO.

Furthermore the check now outputs the physical interfaces for each virtual interface
and raises a warning if not all members have the same speed.
