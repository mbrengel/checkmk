Title: check_ftp: changed service description if the ftp port differs from 21
Level: 1

Class: feature

If a host had two check_ftp services assigned they both shared the same
service description, which resulted in only one check. This has been changed.

If the ftp port differs from 21, the port is also shown in the service
description, e.g. <i>FTP Port 999</i>.

So, if you had any check_ftp services running on a port that differs from 21 they will
have an updated service description.
