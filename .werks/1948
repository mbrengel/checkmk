Class: feature

The import from several independent monitoring sites with duplicated host names was not possible.
We introduced a new command line option for livedump to give you the
possibility to add a individual string as prefix for host names.

C+:
RP: livedump -Cp site1 # dumps the configuration of site1 with prefix site1 for every host name
RP: livedump -Cp site2 # dumps the configuration of site2 with prefix site2 for every host name

RP: livedump -p site1 # dumps the status of site1 with prefix site1 for every host name
RP: livedump -p site2 # dumps the status of site2 with prefix site2 for every host name
