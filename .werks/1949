Title: ibm_svc_host / other license checks: now able to configure limits
Level: 1

The check ibm_svc_host now has configurable host limits via WATO.

Old limits:
<ul>
<li>Check shows errors in case of degraded or offline hosts</li>
<li>Check always is in a OK State</li>
</ul>

New limits:
<ul>
<li>Absolut amount of active hosts - Warning/Critical at or below</li>
<li>Absolute amout of inactive hosts - Warning/Critical at or above</li>
<li>Absolute amout of degraded hosts - Warning/Critical at or above</li>
<li>Absolute amout of offline hosts - Warning/Critical at or above</li>
<li>Absolute amout of other hosts - Warning/Critical at or above</li>
</ul>

This change has been made because it was not possible to configure limits without
warning/critical states. Now all host categories can configured independently.
