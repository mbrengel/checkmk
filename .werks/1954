Discovery function now handles the agent output as followed:
<ul>
<li>File Pattern match: For every matching file a new item is returned and a new service is created.</li>
<li>File Pattern mismatch: This pattern will be ignored. No item is returned and no service is created.</li>
<li>Group Pattern match or mismatch: For every group a new item is returned and a new service is created.</li>
</ul>

Supported agents on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, MacOSX and Solaris now return the same agent output as followed:
[Searchpattern or Absolute file path]|[Filesize or "missing"]|[Modification time of file]
