Title: akcp_exp_humidity, akcp_exp_smoke, akcp_exp_temp, akcp_exp_water: New checks to monitor AKCP securityProbe and expansion boards
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1423134463
Class: feature


Until now Check MK was only able to monitor sensors on the securityProbe monitoring board
which were directly connected to it. Albeit the number of sensors can be increased by daisy
chaining expansion boards to the securityProbe base board.
The new akcp_exp_* checks are designed for this setup.

AKCP sensorProbe boards or securityProbes with no expansion boards connected to them
are still handled by the akcp_sensor_* checks.
