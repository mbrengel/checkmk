Title: printer_input/printer_output: Discovery is using name field when available no
Level: 1

The service discovery of the printer_input/printer_output checks were always using
the index of the unit instead of the name. We have fixed this now.

You don't have to take an immediate action, because already discovered checks will
continue working. But your "Check_MK Discovery" service will report new services
and when you do a re-discovery, the new services will be found.
