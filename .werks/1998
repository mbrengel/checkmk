Title: statgrab_net: New implementation of network interface monitoring via statgrab
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1424349067
Class: feature

Previously when monitoring network interfaces on Solaris and HP-UX you would have
tree checks per Interface: For state, counters, and speed. These three have now
been replaced by one new check simply named {Interface}. This uses the same implementation
as all other interface checks in Check_MK now. This means that you can do configuration
via WATO, have all features like averaging and predictive monitoring, interface grouping
and much more.

Note: This is an incompatible change. You will have to redo service discovery on the
machines using statgrab. The old services will then vanish. New ones will appear. As
long as you do not do this, the existing checks will go to UNKNOWN.
