Title: raritan_pdu_inlet_summary, raritan_pdu_inlet, ups_socomec_outphase: renamed services to be consistent
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

These three checks have been converted to the new generic implementation
for electrical phases. That way the service descriptions have been renamed
to consistently begin with <tt>Input</tt> or <tt>Output</tt>.  Also the word
<tt>Phase</tt> has been moved into the item. And the name of the performance
value <tt>load</tt> has been renamed to <tt>output_load</tt>. This means
that you need to redo service discovery and new RRD databases will be created.
