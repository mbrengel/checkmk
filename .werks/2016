When having hosts configured which have no agent on their own ("No agent" configured via WATO),
but get piggyback data from another host, could not be inventorized. This has been fixed now.

So if you have, for example, an ESX server with several VMs, you configured each VM as host
in WATO and set <i>Agent type</i> to <i>No Agent</i>, you can now discover the services
based on the piggyback data again.
