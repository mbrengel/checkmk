Title: Solaris-Agent: Prevent hanging agent in uptime section

It happened running on a Solaris 8 zone, on a Solaris 10 LDOM, on Sun/Oracle T5
that the agent hung while processing the <tt>uptime</tt> section of the agent.
Many hanging truss and nawk processes were found, which can lead to a unresponsive
and/or crashed system.

The uptime section generating code has been changed and replaced by another mechanism.

Thanks to Clint Squires for analyzing the problem and providing a fix!
