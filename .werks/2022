Title: SNMP: Fixed handling of backslashes in SNMP data
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp

Class: fix

Some checks like the hr_fs checks e.g. create services with
backslashes in the service descriptions when monitoring
windows filesystems. Those services were named "Filesystem c:\\..."
for example, which was using a double backslash which is wrong.
This behaviour has now been changed to just use a single slash.

With this change your services will be reported as UNKNOWN when
you have such services with double backslashes in their names.
You will then need to rediscover the services to get them with
just a single slash. If you like to keep the performance graph
history, you will need to migrate them on your own.
