Title: hyperv_vms: new plugin that allows spaces in VM names
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1424440111

The new plugin uses a vertical tabulator (Ascii 9) instead of spaces as
separators.  By that way spaces in VM names are now allowed. Such names are
e.g. used by snapshot VMs.
