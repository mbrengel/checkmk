Title: netapp_api_temp: add Perf-O-Meter, make configurable via WATO
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1424505260
Class: fix

Note: In order to make this check consistent with the other temperature
checks the service name and the name of the performance variable had to
be renamed. This means that you need to redo service discovery and that
the RRD will be created new.
