Previously services would be sorted alphabetically, e.g. <tt>foo1</tt>,
<tt>foo10</tt>, <tt>foo11</tt>, ... <tt>foo2</tt>, <tt>foo3</tt>, etc.
Now numbers within the descriptions are being detected by a smart algorithm
and the sorting is then <tt>foo1</tt>, <tt>foo2</tt>, ... , <tt>foo9</tt>,
<tt>foo10</tt>, <tt>foo11</tt>, just as you would expect.
