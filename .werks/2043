Title: ibm_svc_mdiskgrp: Fix computation of capacity, show and check provisioning
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1425482173
Class: feature

The check <tt>ibm_svc_mdiskgrp</tt> now also shows the provisioning. You can
now set levels on the provisioning. Note: This is an incompatible change since
a new WATO rule set has been introduced in order to add the new parameter
for the provisioning levels. So if you already have configured levels for
your checks you need to re-do this configuration with the new WATO rule set.
