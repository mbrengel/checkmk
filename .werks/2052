Title: winperf_if: Now able to automatically group teamed interfaces and more
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1425390249
Class: feature

The winperf_if check is now able to detect teamed interfaces.
This information is provided by the updated wmic_if.ps1 plugin.

Right now, the teamed interfaces are no longer listed separately.
There will be a configuration option soon which allows you to configure
this behaviour.

H2: Incompatible change
The service descriptions for this check did never show the human
readable/editable interface name - the <i>NetConnectionID</i>.
This has been fixed. This information is now provided in the alias information
of each interface.<br>
If you have used the configuration option <tt>if_inventory_uses_alias</tt>, the
interface will now have a different name. Therefore the service description changes
and the performance data will get lost.<br>
A workaround for this problem is to use <tt>if_inventory_uses_description</tt> instead.<br>
For windows hosts the setting <tt>if_inventory_uses_alias</tt> and <tt>if_inventory_uses_description</tt>
meant the same in previous versions. With this update only the meaning of <tt>if_inventory_uses_alias</tt> has changed.
