The sidebar snapin "Tree of folders" had an encoding exception in the following setting

<ul>
<li>The user never changed the default values for this snapin</li>
<li>The interface language was different from the default language</li>
<li>The translated text in the snapin contained umlauts like ä, ö, ü</li>
</ul>

This has been fixed.
