Grouped interfaces now clearly show that they are grouped together by listing all
group members and their state in the check output.

Additionally the new port state <i>degraded</i> has been introduced.
A grouped interface is set to this port state if not all of its members are <i>up</i>.
If all members of a group are <i>down</i>, the grouped interface is also considered <i>down</i>, as usual.
