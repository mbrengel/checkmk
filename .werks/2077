Title: Windows MSI Installer: fixed automatical install of agent plugins
Level: 2
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1430735433

Upon install, the MSI installer did not unpack any plugins provided
by the plugins.cap file. You had to manually unpack these plugins
with the command "check_mk_agent.exe unpack plugins.cap".

This has been fixed.
