Title: Added Siemens PLC (SPS) monitoring
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1425295438
Class: feature

We added a special agent {agent_siemens_plc} which is using SNAP7 to fetch
data from a Siemens PLC (SPS) device. You can use it do read memory areas
from the agent, parse and interpret them, for example you can configure
to read and integer from memory location X and handle it as temperature
value in celsius.

For the moment we added a temperature check, others will follow.
