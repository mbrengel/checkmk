Rules in Check_MK BI can be configured to iterate over the childs of parent
nodes for a long time now. But it was not possible to filter the found child
hosts by tags or patterns. The tags which could be configured were only affecting
the parent host. Now it possible to filter the childs by tags or regex patterns.
