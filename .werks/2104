Title: aix_if: new agent section and check
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1426589403
Class: feature

The AIX check_mk_agent has a new section <tt>aix_if</tt> extracting more
information about network interfaces than the previous lnx_if section. A
new interface check for AIX named aix_if has also been created given more
useful information.

As long as you do not replace the check_mk_agent on your AIX systems, nothing will change.
When you replace the agent with the new one, you will have to redo the service discovery.
Interfaces will reappear with the same service description, but with more information about the NIC.
