Title: Allow to filter notification contacts based on values of custom macros
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1426009795
Class: feature

You can now use custom user attributes (macros) for deciding which users should
be notified. For that purpose there is a new check box in the contact selection
of the rule based notifications called <i>Restrict by custom macros</i>.
Here you can specify the name of custom macros and regular expressions for
the allowed values. Users whose macros do not match are being removed from
the list of contacts. Note: You first need to select contacts, the options
just <i>removes</i> contacts, never adds ones.

Custom user attributes can be defined WATO's users module. Please make
sure that you add your macros to the monitoring configuration by selecting
<i>Make this variable available in notifications</i>.
