Title: Unify headers of Host/Service rules, EC rules and notification rules
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

All three types of rules now have a common header with description,
command and documentation URL. The section has been renamed from <i>General
Properties</i> or <i>Additional options</i> to <i>Rule Properties</i>. In
the host and service rules the existing comment information is being used as
description if the description is empty. This is in order to be compatible
with the existing configuration where no description field existed.
