Title: diskstat: new implementation of Linux Disk IO check
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1426173401
Class: feature

The <tt>diskstat</tt> check for Linux has been reimplemented from scratch. It now
gets much more specific metrics information like average wait time, IO queue length,
latency, IOs per seconds und more. Six graphs are being created.

Note: this check is new parametrized by a new rule set in WATO. You need to
redo your configuration of this check, sorry. Also if you have a very old legacy
setup with two seperate checks for read and write, you also need to rediscover.
These checks are not longer supported.
