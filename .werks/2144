Title: Fixed exception in inventory GUI when trying to render dates of inventorized exe files
Level: 1

Till this change the agent provided the installation dates of the exe files in a localized
format (depending on the system locale config). The new agent is now providing a non
localized format which can easily be parsed by the check.

Not parsed installation dates lead to exceptions in the GUI when showing the inventorized
information of a host.
