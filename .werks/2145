Title: LDAP-Sync: Handling user ids with special characters more user friendly
Level: 1

At the moment the Check_MK GUI does not allow to use special characters like
german umlauts in the user ID. By default the LDAP sync pluginn tries to
replace these umlauts with some similar characters, or if enabled, it tries
to skip these users during sync.

But if a user ID contains other special characters, which are not handled by
the LDAP code, this could result in exceptions after synchronising such users.

We improved the handling of those users to skip them silently during
synchronisation. If you miss some users, just enable the diagnostic log and
have a look at the LDAP debug log (located in <tt>var/check_mk/web/ldap-debug.log</tt>
in OMD sites) and search for <tt>Skipped user: ...</tt> entries. If you need
these users within Check_MK please let us know, we will add the needed umlauts
to the translation map.

For future innovation releases we plan to make such special characters usable
in user IDs, then this translation map will not be needed anymore.
