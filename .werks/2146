Title: In distributed environments user notification rules trigger a profile synchronisation now

In previous versions the custom user notification rules were not synchronized to
remote sites in the moment the user changed his rules. An admin had to perform
a synchronisation via WATO to replicate these changes to the rules to the remote
sites for taking effect there.

Now, when a user changes his individual notification rules, a replication of
the updated user profile is triggered.
