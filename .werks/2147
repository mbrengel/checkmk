Title: Fixed exception in HW-/SW-Inventory GUI with special characters in inventorized data
Level: 1
Component: inv
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1426590143

The information fetched from e.g. windows systems were not properly encoded. This could
lead into exceptions when viewing the data in the GUI.

To get these encoding errors fixed, you need to update to this version and then wait
for all your inventory data being updated. After it has been updated, the errors in the
GUI should be gone.
