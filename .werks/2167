Title: SNMPv3: Added support for using SNMP contextes in requests
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427445341
Class: feature

Some devices, which are checked via SNMPv3, offer their SNMP data
in different SNMP contextes. Check_MK can now be configured, based
on the host and check type, to use one or multiple specific SNMPv3
context names in the SNMP requests done for the host and check.

By default Check_MK does not set any context, but if you need it,
simply configure the rule <i>SNMPv3 contexts to use in requests</i>.

Please note to only use this feature when you really need it. By
configuring multiple contextes, all SNMP requests are done once for
each SNMPv3 context. This increases the amount of SNMP communication.
