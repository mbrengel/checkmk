Title: Added action popup to host & service views, supporting custom actions now
Level: 2
Component: multisite

Class: feature

Each host and service has several icons showing up in the web GUI to either
provide options to perform actions or visualizing the state of the object.

Now we reworked the whole thing a bit by adding a popup menu which is groups
together the actions for an object. This aims to reduce the number of icons
shown up in list views.

By default the icon column is now showing the popup menu trigger icon which
can be left clicked to open the popup menu and the graph icon if a host or
service has performance data available. The column is also showing all state
related icons.

Former versions already allowed users to extend the web GUI with so called
in python written icon plugins. This is still possible.
But now, we added the option to easily configure basic actions using WATO.
The configuration is split into two steps:

a) You need to basically configure your custom actions

This is done via the option <i>Custom icons and actions</i> which
can be found in the <i>Status GUI (Multisite)</i> tab of the <i>Global
Settings</i>.

First you need to choose an unique identifier for your action.

Then you can either configure simple icons providing some kind
of information, for example the type of the system, by configuring just
an icon and the title.

If you like to add a custom action, for example a link to the web interface
of one of your devices, you can configure an action URL where you can use
some basic macros:

<ul>
<li>$HOSTNAME$: Contains the name of the host</li>
<li>$SERVICEDESC$: Contains the service description (in case this is a service)</li>
<li>$HOSTADDRESS$: Contains the network address of the host</li>
</ul>

b) Assign the actions to your objects

After you configured at least one custom action, you can use the rules
<i>Custom icons or actions for hosts in status GUI</i> and
<i>Custom icons or actions for services in status GUI</i> to assign
your custom actions to your hosts and services.
