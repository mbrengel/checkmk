Title: Added icon uploader, unified icon selection
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1428915320
Class: feature

Check_MK makes use of icons in views and dashboards, but it is also possible
to add a custom icon to hosts or services for e.g. showing up the type of
the device in a graphical way. This version also adds the option to register
custom icons and actions to host and services.

This change unifies the handling of icons used in such places. We implemented
an icon selector which is used everywhere were you can select an icon. This
icon selector groups the icons together in categories for more comfortable
selection.

We added an icon upload mechanism which gives you the option to manage your
custom icons using WATO. You can find it in the top level navigation of WATO.

All icons are now loaded from a fixed location, in OMD environments this
is <tt>share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icons</tt> for the icons distributed
by us and <tt>local/share/check_mk/web/htdocs/images/icons</tt> for your
custom icons.

Implementation detail: The category of an icon is saved directly in the icon
image. It is stored in the PNG comment metadata.
