Title: ps: allow levels of used RAM in percentage of total RAM of host
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

You can now specify the levels for the memory usage of a process
or group of processes in relation to the total RAM memory of a host.
This makes it easier to find memory consuming processes in general,
without the need for different levels for every single host.

Note: these levels only work if the agent output provides information
about the total memory. This is the case for at least the usual
agents for Linux, Windows and Solaris.
