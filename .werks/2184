Title: statgrab_mem: converted to the same logic as the other memory checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1427814376
Class: feature

The check plugin <tt>statgrab_mem</tt> now uses the same implementation
as <tt>solaris_mem</tt> and many other memory checks. That makes the
output compatible.

Note: This change is incompatible since existing rules for memory
levels do not apply any longer. Now the same WATO rule set as for
other memory checks is being used. Please create new rules if you
have the need for custom levels.
