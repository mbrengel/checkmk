Title: check_mk_agent.aix: use GNU df in order to exclude NFS for filesystem monitoring
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1

Class: feature

If the <tt>df</tt> command from the GNU <tt>coreutils</tt> is present at
<tt>/usr/opt/freeware/bin/df</tt> then that is being used instead of the
AIX <tt>df</tt> command. This avoids a hanging agent in case of hanging
NFS mounts.
