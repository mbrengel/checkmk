When an alert happens then Check_MK lets the core first create a "preliminary" notification.
This is not yet mapped to one or several users but is the starting point for the rule based
notifications. But it is already logged into the monitoring log. After sending out the
actual notifications a further entry for each target user is being logged. A new filter now
allows to select just the final or just the preliminary notifications. It is available in
all log and notification views.
