Class: feature

The Check_MK HW/SW-Inventory now collects information via SNMP. The first
two implemented plugins are for the basic SNMP information and for the list of
network interfaces (switch ports). The latter are available in a new status
view, where you can search ports for various criteria - e.g. all ports where
the type is Ethernet and that are down for at least one month.
All you need to do is to activate the HW/SW-Inventory for such devices.

There is also a view with overal statistics of used and free ethernet ports
of hosts. You can configure via a new rule set <i>Parameters for switch port
inventory</i> which ports should be considere used and free.
