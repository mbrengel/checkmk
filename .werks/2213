Title: cisco_temperature: Fixed behaviour in cases where device reports status but no temperature

Previously, the check would report unknown in cases where the device reports an ok status but no valid
temperature. This behaviour differed from the way the old cisco_temp_perf check handled this. This has
been fixed to be consistent with the old behaviour.
