Title: Allow cancelling actions to be omitted if the cancelled event is not (yet) open
Level: 1

Class: feature

If you have an Event Console rule that uses delaying or counting at the
same time as cancelling, and if this rule furthermore defines actions when
cancelling, then you can have these actions only be executed if the event
has made it in to the <tt>open</tt> phase. The default is still the old
behaviour: that cancelling actions are also executed when the event is still
being delayed or in phase <tt>counting</tt>
