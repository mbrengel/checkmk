Title: Restructured Event Console rules into packs
Level: 2
Component: ec
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

The Event Console now groups event rules into <i>Packs</i>. If you update
to the new version you will find all your existing rules to be contained in
the pack <i>Default rule pack</i>. The execution of the rules within a pack
is just as it was in the global list of rules before. But now you can have
several packs. The execution of the rules is done in the order of the packs
and within each pack in the order there. This helps you to keep on overview -
especially if you have a lot of rules.

But there are a couple of more advantages from the packs:

<ul>
<li>You can easily reorder packs as a whole</li>
<li>Packs can be disabled as a whole</li>
<li>Event simulation can show matching rules on the level of the packs</li>
<li>Rules can be moved from one pack to another</li>
<li>A new rule option in <i>Actions and Outcome</i> can be used to
have a rule skip all other rules in the same pack and continue with the
next one. That way
you can for example create a pack <i>Oracle</i>. As a first rule
you match for <tt>(?!ORA-)</tt> and set the rule type to
<i>Skip this rule pack</i>. That way if a message arrives that does
<i>not</i> contain <tt>ORA-</tt> all of the following rules in that
pack will <i>not</i> by tried out. This can make your configuration
easier and also will speed up the Event Console since the number
of rule tries is being reduced.</li>
</ul>
