Multisite has got a new layout: the <i>Matrix</i>. It allows to group and
compare values of a similar set of services on a list of hosts and many
other things.  This layout uses the group columns for creating vertical
matrix columns (e.g.  the host name) and the first normal column for creating
horizontal columns (e.g.  the service description). All further columns
(most times just one) are displayed in the cells.

This new layout has been used to create two new views: a global view <i>Search
performance data</i> in the topic <i>Metrics</i> and one that can be accessed
in the details of a host group. Both show all services of the selected hosts
of of the search in a host by services matrix. Simply try it out!

If one line in a matrix view has the same value for a majority of entries
then all entries with differing values will be hilighted. That way you can
use the matrix layout in order to find configuration differences between
the same service on different hosts.
