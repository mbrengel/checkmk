Title: More transparently show errors during service discovery
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1

Class: feature

Checks might run into problems parsing the output of an agent plugin. When
this happens during a normal check, you will soon know this as the according
service goes <i>UNKNOWN</i> and you will be able to create a crash dump.

Errors in single check plugins during service discovery, however, have been
silently ignored unless you used <tt>--debug</tt> on the command line. This
behaviour has been changed in the following way:

H2:<tt>cmk -I</tt> on the command line

Now for each files plugin a warning is being printed, but the discovery
continues. <tt>--debug</tt> will let the Python exception come through
and abort the discovery with a precise error message - just as it used
to be.

H2:Check_MK Discovery service

The discovery check now in case of an error during the discovery goes
to <i>UNKNOWN</i> and produces a crash dump - just as normal checks do.
That way you can easily send us a crash report in case of any error.
Previously error would be ignored silently.

H2:Service list in WATO

In WATO the list of a host's services will display a yellow error
message if one of the plugins fails. This messages has a link for
retrying the discovery without the error message and that way switch
back to the old behaviours (temporarliy).

H2:Bulk discovery in WATO

The bulk discovery keeps to the old behaviour of silently ignoring
errors but has got a new checkbox for letting a host fail if at
least one check plugin of the host runs into an error. The default
setting of the checkbox is to ignore errors.
