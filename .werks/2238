Postfix mail queue check creates incorrect rrd data sources. This results in a lot of unnecessary rrd files.

You can delete those files to save hard disc space. But keep in mind, that you will loose the historic
data. Graphs can have areas with missing data.

Those files are stored at following locations:
<ul>
  <li>~/var/check_mk/rrd</li>
  <li>~/var/pnp4nagios/perfdata</li>
</ul>

You can delete those files with those commands:
C+:
  find ~/var/check_mk/rrd -type f -iname "postfix_mail_queue_*_size*" -exec rm '{}' \;
  find ~/var/pnp4nagios/perfdata -type f -iname "postfix_mail_queue_*_size*" -exec rm '{}' \;
C-:

If you have set up a new monitoring site with version 1.2.8, there are multi RRDs in use.
If you want to clean up those files, please contact us with via your support address.

The graphs of size and length of the queues have been adapted to correct this mistake.
All several performance data is collected in one graph.
