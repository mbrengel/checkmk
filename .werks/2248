Title: The Event Console can now translate incoming SNMP traps
Level: 2
Component: ec
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1430307780
Class: feature

The Event Console can be configured to receive SNMP traps. In the past it
only extracted all raw OIDs and values from the incoming trap and putting
them together in the event message as they come in.

Now it is possible to use SNMP MIB files to let the Event Console translate
the OIDs, values and units contained in the traps.

This feature is disabled by default. You need to enable the Event Console
and the SNMP trap handling by using <tt>omd config</tt> in OMD environments.

Then you need to enable the trap translation in <i>Event Console > Settings</i>
by setting <i>Translate SNMP traps</i> to <i>on</i>. Finally you need to
activate the pending EC-Change.

Now all available MIBs will be used to translate the incoming traps.

You can now upload custom MIB files using the MIB management page at
<i>Event Console > SNMP MIBs</i> which will be used for translation after
reloading the Event Console.
