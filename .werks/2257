Normaly it is not allowed to have different hosts with equal name in Check_MK.
But it is possible to configure this, e.g. by creating hosts with an equal
name on different sites (we do not recommend to do this).

This change tries to fix handling of this situation in the GUIs views, where
a user clicks on a host/service which is present on multiple sites but the user intends
to get the host/service from a specific view. In the past this situation
was not handled clearly which lead to a view showing data of the two equal
named hosts where the user expected only data of one.
