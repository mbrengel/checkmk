Title: Fixed wrong pnp template cache path in non OMD environments
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1433253304
Class: fix

Previous versions used /temp/check_mk_pnp_template_cache which was working,
but not intended. The path has been changed to /tmp/check_mk_pnp_template_cache
now. You can savely delete the old directory.

This only affects manual installations of Check_MK.
