Title: windows agent: "check_mk_agent.exe test" now also outputs stderr of plugins
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1432024643
Class: feature

If you need stdout only simply use <tt>check_mk_agent.exe file myfile</tt>.

This feature also includes a small fix. If a plugin script wrote something to
stderr there was a possibility that the following stdout information was skipped.
This bug was only observed on a Win2k3 system.
