Title: windows agent: new subfolders, improved folder cleanup during uninstall
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i1

Class: feature

The windows agent now comes with the following folders

<table>
<tr><th>Folder</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>local</td><td>local scripts</td></tr>
<tr><td>plugins</td><td>plugin scripts</td></tr>
<tr><td>config</td><td>configuration files for scripts</td></tr>
<tr><td>state</td><td>state files for scripts and the agent, e.g. logwatch state</td></tr>
<tr><td>spool</td><td>spoolfiles from other applications</td></tr>
<tr><td>log</td><td>logfiles from scripts and the agent</td></tr>
<tr><td>temp</td><td>working directory for scripts</td></tr>
</table>

When you update the agent to a newer version, the content of this folders will not get deleted.
Only during the uninstall everything is cleaned up, with two exceptions.
Self-written scripts in the <i>local</i> and <i>plugin</i> folders are not automatically
deleted during uninstall. These files will linger around till you remove them manually.


The incompatible part of this werk is the changed location of the state files for the
logwatch and logfiles checks. These files were located in the agent directory, now they
are located in the subdirectory <i>state</i>. As a result, if you start the new agent there
will be no known last offsets of the logwatch and the eventlog monitoring. In this scenario
the agent will start at the end.
If you want to start at the old offsets, you need to copy the files <i>logstate.txt</i> and
<i>eventstate.txt</i> into the <i>state</i> directory.
