Title: printer_supply: now able to toggle the point of view for used and remaining material

There is a <i>Upturn toner levels</i> option available which allows you
to switch the point of view from the remaining- to the used-perspective.
This was useful, because there are waste toner boxes which count in the
different direction.

In case of waste toner boxes the upturn feature was hardcoded on.
However, depending on the manufacturer the count direction differs...
With this change the upturn option now toggles the direction every time,
so it doesn't matter if the component is a cartridge or a waste toner box.

After updating to this version, you should check the toner levels and
set the <i>Upturn toner levels</i> accordingly.
