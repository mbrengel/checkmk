Title: logwatch: Remove global setting logwatch_service_output from WATO
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1432123043
Class: feature

This setting decides wether (default) or not to output the last critical
found message in a logfile in the output of the check plugin of logwatch
checks. You still can set this variable in <tt>main.mk</tt> if you like.
Existing setting still work.

This make Check_MK more consistent: there are no settings for checks
in the global settings any more now.
