Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1432130938
Class: feature

The selection wether empty DHCP should be discovered has now been moved into
a rule set. If you had set the global option then it is still functioning
and can be overridden on a per-host-basis with rules.
