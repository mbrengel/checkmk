What now has a new module <i>Check Plugins</i> that is essentially a complete catalog
of all check plugins that your installation has installed. It contains shipped plugins
as well as locally installed ones (if they have a man page that is).

From the man pages you can directly jump to the according rule set for the parameters
of the check. Also links to the manual page have been added in the new service command
menu and in the WATO service list.
