Title: windows agent: now replaces BOM (byte order marks) from local and plugin scripts
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

Some windows plugins recklessly reported byte order marks
at the beginning of their output, which lead problems when
the data was evaluated.

With this change byte order marks will be replaced by empty lines.
Empty lines in the agent output are ignored, so there won't be any
side effects.
