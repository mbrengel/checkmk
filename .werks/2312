Title: New checks for EMC VPLEX: emc_vplex_cpu, emc_vplex_director_stats, emc_vplex_if, emc_vplex_volumes
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1435149632
Class: feature

These new checks provide information for

<ul>
<li>Director disks IO throughput and latency</li>
<li>Directors frontend and backend interface statistics</li>
<li>Directors CPU utilization</li>
<li>Volume IO throughput and latency</li>
</ul>

Note: The EMC VPLEX devices currently do not provide a SysDescr OID, which is
considered as a bug. If you want to discover these checks you need to configure
these hosts with the rule <i>"Hosts without system description OID"</i> (snmp_without_sys_descr).
Otherwise these devices will fail at the start of the service discovery.

Additional note: It seems that the snmp information is only updated every 90 seconds.
We highly recommend to set the check interval for these checks (actually the Check_MK check)
to 120 seconds. If you query the system every minute there will be errors in the rate computation
of the interfaces and other side effects.
