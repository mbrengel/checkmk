This new special agent queries the web interface of a Ruckus Spot service.
It reports access point information for the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.

For each band the information consists of
<ul>
<li>Number of devices</li>
<li>Number of time drift problems</li>
<li>Number of devices not responding</li>
</ul>

You can configure levels for the <i>time drift</i> and <i>not responding</i> problems.
Without further configuration the check is always OK.
