Title: oracle_tablespaces: correctly handle case where check runs in clustered mode
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

The check for the ORACLE tablespaces now works correctly when Check_MK
cluster hosts are being used. In such a case data files may appear twice in
the agent output - once for each node of the cluster. The check now considers
that node that has the most data files as the active node and uses the data
from that node.
