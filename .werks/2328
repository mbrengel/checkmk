The problem appeared especially when distributing changes with WATO in a
distributed setup. The reason was: the reload of the configuration closed
and reopened the UNIX socket that is used for sending commands. That way
parallel connections would be closed. Now the UNIX socket is only reopened
when the configuration parameter <i>Max. number of pending connections to
the status socket</i> has changed and a reload is thus neccessary in order
to make that change active.
