Title: Discovery service: Fixed handling of agent / SNMP communication errors
Level: 1
Component: core
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1433341742

When a host could not be contacted via agent or did not receive an SNMP response,
this resulted in a situation where the check was shown as UNKNOWN and broken check
with the hint to send a bug report the us.

This handling has been changed to reporting a WARNING state together with the related
error message as output. The "crashed check" link is not displayed for this case anymore.
