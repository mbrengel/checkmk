Title: LDAP Sync: Automatically syncing credential changes to slave sites in distributed setups
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1434967888
Class: feature

When using the LDAP sync while having a distributed setup users might not be able to access
the GUI on the slave sites when their password was changed in LDAP. This could only be
fixed by an admin which performed a manual WATO synchronisation of the current configuration.

This has now been changed. When the password change has been detected, the master site tries
to synchronize the profile of the user to the configured and reachable remote site(s). If
this fails, the site is marked as "to be synchronized". Then the admin can perform the sync
manually once the site is available again.
