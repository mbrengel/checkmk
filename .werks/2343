Title: Rule Based Notifications GUI can now deal with latin-1 encoded plugin output in backlog
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

When a plugin produces output containing latin-1 encoded characters, these are transparently
handled by the core and forwarded to the notification engine. The notifications are already
sent out correctly, but the RBN configuration dialog was not able to display these notifications
when using the <i>Analyse</i> function. This lead to exceptions.

The GUI has now been fixed to also support latin-1 encoded notification information.

However, better write your plugins to output UTF-8 encoded characters.
