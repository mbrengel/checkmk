In previous versions it was possible to create a non working BI configuration
using the BI editor by creating an aggregation which calls a BI rules which
needs one or several arguments, but not providing any argument in the BI aggregation.
Saving this configuration was possible and caused problems in different places
of the GUI, for example the report editor when rendering the BI filters.

The editor has been extended to do a better validation to prevent this kind of
misconfiguration.
