Title: FreeBSD Agent: Changed bash path to /usr/local/bin/bash
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1435570316
Class: fix

Older versions of the FreeBSD Agent used the /bin/bash path as interpreter
which seem not to be standard conform. It has now been changed to
<tt>/usr/local/bin/bash</tt> in the hope that this is now correct and not
breaking existing setups.
