Title: FreeBSD Agent: Made plugin/local paths standard conform
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1435570513
Class: fix

The former paths <tt>/usr/lib/check_mk_agent</tt> were not correct according
to FreeBSD standards. We have now switched the path to <tt>/usr/local/lib/check_mk_agent</tt>.
If you currently use the old paths, you will need to move this directory to
the new location when using the new agent.
