Title: livestatus_status: no not alarm switched off host freshness nor event handlers on CMC <= 1.2.6
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1435059274
Class: fix

CMC version 1.2.6 did not have event handlers. So they are always switched
off. The check will no longer warn about this. Host freshness checking is
turned off per default in OMD based installations for the Nagios core. Per
default alerting this also has been disabled.
