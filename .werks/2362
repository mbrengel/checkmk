Title: mk_logwatch: fix cases where one logfile is listsed more than once in logwatch.cfg
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1435578702
Class: fix

One example of such a case:

F+:logwatch.cfg
/var/log/syslog /var/log/kern.log
 C panic
 C Oops
 W generic protection rip
 W .*Unrecovered read error - auto reallocate failed

/var/log/kern.log
 C INFO
F-:

In the old implementation the line with <tt>C INFO</tt> would never be executed.
Now it is appended at the bottom of the other patterns for <tt>kern.log</tt>.

Thanks to Gregor Hoffleit for the patch!
