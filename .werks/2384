Title: Prevent user passwords from being visible in webserver log on user creation

When a user is created using WATO, the set values of the form fields were logged
directly into the webserver access log, because the form of this page used the
GET request method. Users which have access to the log files would be able to
see the initial passwords. If you use an older version of Check_MK it is a good
idea to set the "Change password at next login or access" to force the user
to change his password on first login.

We changed this form to perform a POST request now to prevent these information
being written to the logs.
