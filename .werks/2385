Title: Fixed possible reflected XSS on all GUI pages where users can produce unhandled exceptions

On pages where an authenticated user can trigger an exception which is then displayed
to the user as "Internal error" dialog with details about the exception, it was possible
for the user to inject javascript code which was executed in the context of the authenticated
user.

This has been fixed that javascript/html code which is injected is being escaped correctly.
