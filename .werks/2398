Starting with python 2.7.9 the ssl certificate of the target server is always validiated.
This caused problems when the certfile was not correctly registered on the monitoring server.

You can now choose in the datasource program, to disable the certificate check.
If this check should be done, you can configure if the hostname or a better suited hostname
should be used for this validiation.
