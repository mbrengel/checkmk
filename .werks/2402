Title: netapp_api_disk: fixed broken WATO and check configuration
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

Incorrect parameters were used within the WATO and the check configuration.
This check got an incomplete rework two months ago where naming for the parameters got changed.
This fix is able to migrate any existing old configuration, so there are no further changes required.
