Changes made on a distributed WATO slave site could delay a configuration update attempt from the master.

Detailed information: Any changes on a slave site which lead to a pending log entry triggered the cmcrushd.
The cmcrushd creates a configuration for the microcore, which takes precendence over creating the configuration anew.
When a snapshot got pushed from the master site, the slave site thought that there is already a precompiled configuration
available and used the cmcrushd configuration.

This problem is automatically resolved on the following configuration push from the master,
because the cmcrushd configuration is only used once.
