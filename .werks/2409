Title: AIX DB2 monitoring: the agent plugin now processes all db2 instances in parallel
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3

Class: feature

The mk_db2.aix plugin now uses a separate cache file for each db2 instance.
This allows parallel processing of all instances at the same time.
The performance of the system should not suffer. It was tested on a system with 50+ db2 instances.

Furthermore the db2 checks will no longer all report UNKNOWN when an instance is stopped.
The instance checks will now go stale (no data was reported) and the db2_version check will
go to CRIT.

The db2_logsizes check now finally works.. There was a typo in the previous checkname.
