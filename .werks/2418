Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1438784205

The agent_vsphere.pysphere is now able to accept the option --no-cert-check, which was introduced a month ago.
However, it is only implemented as a dummy. SSL certificate checking is not supported in the legacy version.
