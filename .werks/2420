Title: mk_db2.aix: now able to monitor partitioned databases
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1439995843
Class: feature

The check db2_logsizes, db2_counters and db2_bp_hitratios are now able to
process data from partitioned databases (DBF mode). Previously, the checks ran into
an exception because the mk_db2.aix plugin reported incorrect formatted data.

Please note that you have to update the mk_db2.aix plugin on your db2 hosts
if you want to monitor databases in DBF mode. However, there is no need to do this.
The new checks are also able to work with the old mk_db2.aix plugin.
