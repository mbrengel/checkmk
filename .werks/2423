Title: interface checks: now able to configure absolute levels for error packets
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1440590161
Class: feature

You can now configure absolute levels for the error package rate.

Note: These new levels are configured as a tuple of integers.
The previous version of this check did not distinguish between percentual levels
configured as pair of int or float.
If you configured the old error rates as int tuples (which was an error in the first place),
you have to update these rules accordingly.
