Title: esx_vsphere_counters: improved handling when data is missing
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1440602655
Class: feature

A few times per day, the ESX system reports invalid counter values.
This is an ESX issue and can't be fixed. The esx_vsphere_counter checks were unable
to work with this invalid/missing data. This has been fixed.
