Title: Users with access to host/services can now edit the disabled services rule for their hosts/folders
Level: 1
Component: wato

Class: feature

In previous versions it was only possible to permit users to edit either all rulesets or no ruleset
related to the folders they are permitted for.

For example users were able to edit their hosts in their WATO folders, perform services discoveries
on these hosts, but were not able to configure the disabled services for these hosts. This has been
changed now for the "Disabled Services" ruleset.
