Title: Hiding not permitted actions from service discovery page when only permitted on host

When users are only permitted on hosts/folders in WATO, the service discovery page showed
buttons and action icons which resulted in an error message when a user not having permissions
on the services clicked on them. These action buttons are now hidden when the user is not
permitted, making the page read-only when user is only permitted to host.
