Class: feature

Using the GUI it was not possible to create users having user IDs containing special
characters like e.g. German umlauts. But in environments where user synchronizations
with LDAP directories is used it might happen that users with sucht user IDs need
to be synchronized into Check_MK. This was in possible in earlier versions,
which lead to some kind of inconsistencies.

To have a consistent situation for all users independent of their source, Check_MK
now allows you to create users which user IDs contain special characters.

If you already have configured a LDAP synchronization and set the option
"Translate Umlauts in User-IDs" to "replace", your already synchronized users will
be left untouched for the moment. But it is recommended to set this option to
"Keep special characters" now to allow your users to use their normal user IDs for
logging in. But please note, if you change this option, your users having special
characters in user IDs are deleted and re-created with the new name during next
LDAP sync. You will need to migrate the users profile (<tt>var/check_mk/web/[user_id]</tt>)
to make them able to use their custom views, dashboards, bookmarks etc. again after
renaming.
