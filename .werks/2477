Class: fix

When processing SNMP tables which have a) end OIDs which are not increasing and
b) some columns are missing some indexes, this could lead into mixed up rows and
even exceptions during processing of this data.

This occured e.g. on Bintec RLX125000 devices where the interfaces OIDs were
not reported in numerical order by their end OIDs as one would expect in SNMP.
