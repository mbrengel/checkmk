Title: Remove special handling for non-distributed-setups in WATO
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1437988947
Class: feature

The handling of the activation of changes of single site setups was completely
different than the case where you have a distributed setup with more than one
Check_MK site. In order to simplify code, documentation and user experiance
this distinction now has been removed. A single-site setup now exactly looks
like and behaves like a distributed setup with just one site. This has no
influence on performance or security.
