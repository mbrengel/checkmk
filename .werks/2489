Title: cmciii_lcp_water: New check replacing cmciii_lcp_waterin/out, support for newer devices
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1438077951
Class: fix

This is a more robust reimplementation of the Water-In/Out checks that also works for
newer firmware and has been converted to the new temperature handling and thus also
allows for custom levels (if you want to override those set in the device itself).

Note: You need to reinventorize the hosts in order to use the new check.
