Title: Implemented new crash report handling
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1438246315
Class: feature

Some versions ago we introduced a reporting mechanism for crashes within the checks
and the GUI. It was possible to click on a "report crash" button which opened a
"new mail" dialog containing the crash information. The problem with this approach
was that when using Outlook it resulted in incomplete crash dumps which were mostly
unusable.

The reporting mechanism has been completely reworked. The reports are now sent via
HTTP POST calls to our crash reporting server. To be able to contact you in case
of any question, we need your name and email address when you submit a crash report.

All information which is submitted to our servers is displayed to you before
submitting. You can always choose not to report a crash.
