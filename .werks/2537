Class: feature

The WATO module for BI aggregations has undergone a slight rework. Aggregations and Rules are
now show on separate pages. In the table of aggregations you now can unfold the tree of rules
(which is not the same as the final tree of items).

A new page shows all rules that are not called by any other aggregation or rule. This helps
to cleanup your configuration.
