Title: Silently ignore not existing painters and sorters in views

In previous versions Check_MK raised exceptions when a view is using sorters
or painters that do not exist anymore. This could easily happen for the painters
and sorters created dynamically for each tag group. 

Check_MK is now silently skipping these sorters and painters to prevent the 
exception and make use of such views possible again. You can then remove
those sorters / painters using the view editor.
