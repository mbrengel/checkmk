The trap translation was only translating keys, values and units of OIDs provided with a trap.
You can now configure the Event Console to append the description of the OIDs (if available
via the MIB) to the event texts.

To make this work you may need to re-upload your MIB files you want to have a translation for.

This translation option can be enabled using the global settings of the Event Console. Please
note that if you have existing rules to machting SNMP traps and you change this option, the
texts of incoming events will change. So you might have to adapt your events text matching
patterns.
