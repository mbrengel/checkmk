Title: apache_status: fixed computation of bytes and requests per second
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1441279892

Bytes/second and Requests/second were previously averages since the start of the server and did
therefore not hold useful information about the current server load.
Now these values are "live" rates, calculated based on changes in Total Accesses and Total kBytes.
