Title: Discovery check can now automatically add missing services and also activate changes
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

You can now have the <i>Check_MK Discovery</i> check automatically repair
things by adding missing services or even removing vanished services. This is
activated by using the new rule set <i>Periodic Discovery Check</i> instead
of the previous (now deprecated) global option <i>Enable regular service
discovery checks</i>. In the new rule set you can activate and configure
this feature on a per-host base.

Also the discovery check can now warn about vanished services. The default
is that vanished services will not set the state to WARN, however, and just
display them. So unless you change the configuration the behaviour of the
discovery check has not changed.

<b>Note</b>: Automatically removing vanished services can be dangerous as
broken things like missing file systems or even switch ports that went down
will be removed from the monitoring! Only use in special situations where
this is no problem.
