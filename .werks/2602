Title: Tracking of incompatible Werks
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1443102230
Class: feature

This new feature helps you updating your configuration after an update to
a newer Check_MK version. Check_MK now keeps track about all <i>Incompatible
Werks</i>. Such a Werk denotes a software change that <i>might</i> require your
knowledge or interaction.  In many cases it is just a service rediscovery of
some affected hosts that needs to be done. In other cases manual adaptation
of your configuration is neccessary.

Check_MK now shows you all such Werks in the new version page (click on the
Check_MK version number at the top of the sidebar for going there). If you
have admin permissions then you can actively acknowledge incompatible werks
that you already have checked until you are <i>clean</i>. After each software
update you now will see at one glance if some new incompatible Werk has happened
since your last update.

Note: In order to keep things easy the tracking does not include any Werk
that appeared in a version before the start of the 1.2.7 version branch.
