Title: cisco_temperature: Reduced SNMP overhead for large devices
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3

Class: fix

The cisco_temperature check makes use of the SNMP table
.1.3.6.1.2.1.47.1.1.1.1.2 to gather the description of the sensors.

This table can be very large on some devices. Check_MK normally
needs to fetch the whole table because of it's architecture e.g.
to make the service discovery possible.

But since this table is normally static, it is not needed to fetch
this large table during every check.

Check_MK is now caching this table during checking. The cache is
renewed when performing service discovery (either manually or
automatically via the discovery service).
