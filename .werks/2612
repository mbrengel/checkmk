Title: Fixed possible XSS on service detail page using the long service output

Normaly all check results displayed in the GUI are HTML escaped by default.
The escaping was missing for the long service output of the service detail
page. So one could create multi line check results containing HTML/Javascript
code which would be executed when a user opens the service detail page of
the service with the check result containing the injected code.

The issue has been fixed by escaping the long output exactly like the normal
plugin output. One difference is left: newline characters are replaced by
HTML newlines to make displaying of multiple lines still possible.

If you want the old behaviour back, you can disable the plugin output escaping
using the global settings. But please note that an attacker might be able to
inject javascript code.
