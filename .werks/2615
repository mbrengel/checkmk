When you have legacy dashoards (defined via plugin, located below local/share/check_mk/web/plugins/dashboards) defined which include a view where some of your users don't have access to and these
users are the first ones to access the GUI after apache reload/restart, this could result
in exceptions like this for other users: "KeyError: 'datasource'".
