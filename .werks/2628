Title: check_bi_aggr service now also goes into downtime if the monitored BI aggregation is in downtime
Level: 1
Component: bi
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1442910035
Class: feature

the service is assigned a "real" downtime even if the downtime of the bi is derived from the
aggregated services.
The downtime is also removed automatically when the bi leaves its own downtime.
Assignment and removal of the downtime happens only when the check is run so there will be a delay
between bi going into downtime and the service following.
