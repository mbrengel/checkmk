Title: New system for displaying time graphs of metrics
Level: 3
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3

Class: feature

Check_MK now has a new implementation of how metrics time graphs (formerly
known as performance graphs or PNP graphs) are being created.  Instead of
hand crafted PNP templates, templates are now being created by Check_MK's
new metrics system.

In the new declaration file
<tt>share/check_mk/web/plugins/metrics/check_mk.py</tt> all names of
performance variables are being assigned to units, titles and colors.
Graph and Perf-O-Meter definitions both make use of these.

The advantages are:

LI:Graphs and Perf-O-Meters are much simpler to declare
LI:Graphs and Perf-O-Meters now share the same color scheme
LI:Graphs are more streamlined
LI:It is now much easier to change some general properties of all graphs
LI:Default graphs are more intelligent
LI:Future addons that work with metrics data are easier to implement

Note: existing PNP templates have not been removed but still exist and
have precedence over the automatically generated ones. But they will not be
maintained anymore and no new manual templates will be created by us anymore.
