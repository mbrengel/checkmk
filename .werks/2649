Title: Bulk renaming of hosts in WATO

The function for renaming hosts in WATO is now available in a new bulk
mode. This is a new button in each folder, where you can recursively rename
hosts in a generic way. There are several types of renamings that can be done:

LI:case translation into lower or upper case
LI:adding and removing suffixes
LI:adding prefixes
LI:regular expression operations (much like <tt>sed</tt>)
LI:explicit mappings

For each affected site only <b>one</b> restart of the site is needed. This
can speed up renaming operations with lots of hosts drastically when compared
to renaming each host apart.
