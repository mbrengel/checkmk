Title: Do not allow adding of duplicate hosts anymore
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1444824195
Class: feature

WATO now makes sure that you cannot add a host with a name that already
exists in some folder anymore. That avoids problems when later activating
changes (where duplicate hosts are not allowed anyway).  Note: In previous
versions you <i>could</i> have created a host with the same name on different
sites. This is not possible anymore.
