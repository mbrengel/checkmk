Title: jolokia_metrics: better handling of situation where agent does not respond
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3

Class: fix

In case the Jolokia agent cannot be queried the Check_MK services does not
any longer complain about missing agent sections. Instead on the main
service of the instance goes CRIT and all other services will be skipped
and become stale. This avoids bogus notifications.
