Title: logwatch: fixed high memory and cpu usage caused by too many unacknowledged messages
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Due to a change in werk 2414, the local copy of the monitored logfile continued to grow and was
parsed in every check cycle. With growing file size this could cause extreme cpu and memory load.
This fix is twofold:
a) The check now stops appending to the file once the filesize limit is reached. This was the behaviour
pre-2414 anyway
b) The configurable reclassification patterns are now only applied to old loglines once after each
change to the patterns.

Please note that this doesn't automatically truncate the copy of the logfile if it already exceeds the
size limit.
