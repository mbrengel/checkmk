Title: Windows Agent can now read additional settings from an optional check_mk_local.ini file
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3

Class: feature

The settings from check_mk_local.ini (if it exists) will be merged with the settings from
check_mk.ini in a reasonable way.
What is reasonable depends a lot on the parameter. Settings that have only one value (i.e. port)
will simply be overwritten by the "local" settings.
Many settings that can appear repeatedly, i.e. performance counters, will be appended.
Yet other settings, especially those with pattern where only the first match applies, the "local"
settings will be prepended to the existing settings (thus have higher priority).

If in doubt about how the files are being combined, you can run "check_mk_agent.exe showconfig" to
display the effective settings after merging the two files.
