Title: logwatch: unacknowledged messages exceeding the max size are now dropped, even if they were already stored due to a previous bug
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1444649368

A previous modification to the logwatch check caused the internal message buffer
(var/check_mk/logwatch) to become bloated, causing high cpu load and memory usage.
This change now auto-corrects those files for those affected.
