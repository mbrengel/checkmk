Title: knuerr_rms_temp: switch to new generic temperature logic, allow e.g. lower levels
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1444989479
Class: feature

This check now uses the generic mechanism for all temperature checks
and thus allows things like lower levels or display in Fahreheit (in in
future also trend monitoring).  The service description has changed from
<tt>Temperature</tt> to <tt>Temperature Ambient</tt> (in order to comply
with the guidelines). You need to redo service discovery for this check.
