Title: SNMP-Traps: Fixed translation of OIDs which are parts of trap values

Class: fix

Some traps send SNMP OIDs as values of traps which were not translated correctly
in the past. For example default SNMPv2 traps had a non-translated numeric OID
in the "Application" field of the events. This has now been changed to be
translated too.

Please note: If you already have created rules which refer to the numeric OIDs
while having trap translation enabled, you will need to update the rules.
