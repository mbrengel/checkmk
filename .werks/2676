Title: cisco_asa_failover: Failover state is not treated as warning state anymore
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

The Cisco ASA cluster is operating as expected and in practice, it does not really
matter which of the cluster members is the primary one. So the failover state, where
the secondary device is the active one, is not treated as warning anymore.
