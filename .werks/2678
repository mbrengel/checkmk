Level: 1

Class: feature

The new LDAP sync plugin can be used to set custom user attributes
based on the group memberships in LDAP.

This plugin can be used to set custom user attributes to specified values
for all users which are member of a group in LDAP.

If a user is not a member of a group, the attribute will be left at it's
default value. When a single attribute is set by multiple groups and a
user is member of multiple of these groups, the later plugin in the list
will override the others.
