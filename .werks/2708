Title: sap, sap_state: new sap_state service reports connection problems to sap hosts
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1446559117
Class: feature

The new sap_state service will be discovered on the host(s) running the sap agent plugin, one service
for each configured host.
This service will report all problems preventing the system from reporting information about the sap
instance.
The remaining sap services will now not become "unknown", but keep their last state and turn stale
after a while.
