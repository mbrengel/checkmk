Class: feature

The bookmark sidebar snapin has been extended to be structurable into
topics. Each bookmark can now be put into a topic which can then be expanded
or closed in the GUI.

It is now possible to group bookmarks together in multiple bookmark
lists. These lists can be made available to other users, just like views,
dashboards, reports and graph collections.

The summary of all bookmark lists a user can access is grouped together in
the bookmark snapin and shown to the user as one single list of bookmarks.
