Title: Removed debug notification script (was not executable)
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown

The script was only meant for debug/demonstration purposes. This
script was not usable from the GUI except one made it executable.

These days you can use the HTML notifications to get a list of
all notifiction variables, if you need them e.g. for debugging.
