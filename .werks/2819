Title: netapp_api_if: now able to detect even more interfaces
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1450363196
Class: fix

The check was unable to detect interfaces with no link-status information.
Some interfaces (especially virtual ones) often simply report an operational-status.
The check now uses the operational-status information in case the link-status is missing.
