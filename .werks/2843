Notification scripts are assumed to finish within short time like a couple
of seconds. If a notification script takes longer or is hanging for ever,
it prevent Check_MK from sending out other notifications. So one hanging
notification could prevent all others.

This has been fixed by introducing a global notification plugin timeout.
All notification plugins which take more than 60 seconds will be killed
so that other notifications can be done again. If you need a different
timeout, you can configure it using the global setting "Notification plugin timeout".
