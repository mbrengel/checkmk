Title: ewon: Added support for monitoring Wagner OxyReduct devices with their data exposed through an ewon router
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1449071132
Class: feature

The Wagner OxyReduct device (or chamber) can't be monitored directly but via the eWON 2005CD router
their measurements can be exposed via snmp. This check monitors the OxyReduct through this channel
and lays the groundwork for monitoring further devices exposed through the same router.
