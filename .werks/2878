Class: feature

The <i>Search</i> functionality in WATO has been completely reworked. The search
results are now displayed just like a folder. All single-host and bulk operations
are now possible on the search result. You can edit, delete and move the found
hosts (or some hereof), can cleanup attributes, do discovery and even can do
parent scan.
