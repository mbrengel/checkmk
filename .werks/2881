Title: Automatically restart core instead of reload after changes in local check plugins
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

If you create, remove or modify you own check plugins in
<tt>~/local/share/check_mk/checks</tt> then usually had to do a real core
restart with <tt>cmk -R</tt> in order to activate these changes. This is now
done automatically. Whenever you do <i>Activate Changes</i> then Check_MK
does a real restart on demand if it sees any modification in the check plugins.
This also helps the handling of installing and removing Check_MK packages (MKPs).
