The Bulk Host Import feature of WATO could be used for importing a list of host names
before. But more complex imports like adding hosts together with a collection of initial
attributes was not possible.

The import has now been extended that one can upload whole CSV files or paste the contents
of a CSV file into a form. Then, after the upload, a preview page is displayed to configure
the parameters how to parse the CSV file and which column to assign to which host attribute.
