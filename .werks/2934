Title: All temperature checks now have the same comprehensive featureset
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1453300152
Class: feature

Over 100 check plugins were touched in this update. For most of these checks
it won't be necessary to rediscovery, but once you do, item names on many
checks will change.

Service descriptions have also been normalized but to ease the transition
from existing setups, the old service description will continue to show on
existing installations.

If you have an existing installation and would like to switch to
the new service descriptions you can toggle them in:
{{Global Settings|Execution of checks|Use new service descriptions}}.

Finally, all temperature checks can now be configured through the same rule
and support the same features (like configurable unit, support for trend
computations, upper and lower thresholds and so on).  Unfortunately this
means that most existing rules for temperature checks will no longer be
applied and disappear from the {{Host- & service parameters}} list.  Please make
sure you carry over all important temperature rules!

You can still see the now deprecated rules through the
button {{Deprecated Rulesets}} in {{Host & Service Parameters}}.
