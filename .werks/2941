Tinkerforge is a manufacturer of buildings blocks (include many sensor blocks) that can be combined
and assembled freely. The assembled devices can be connected to via usb, ethernet or wifi.
The current range of checks supports the blocks (so called bricklets) included in the
"Server Room Monitoring"-kit:
 - Ambient Light sensor
 - Humidity sensor
 - Motion sensor
 - Temperature sensor
 - Master brick

The plugin can also be configured to display sensor readings on the integrated 7-segment display.
