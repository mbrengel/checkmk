Title: juniper_cpu_util: new check replaces juniper_cpu which was reporting incorrect values
Level: 1

Class: fix

The juniper_cpu check was reporting cpu load as utilization. The load readings from the
juniper device can't be used as the number of cpu cores is unknown.

juniper_cpu has been obsoleted, will no longer report data and will disappear upon
re-discovery.
juniper_cpu_util takes its place and reports the actual utilization.
