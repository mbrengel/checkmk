Title: MongoDB: Introduced agent plugin and some checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1453996031
Class: feature

After installing the mk_mongodb agent plugin on the target system, the following new
checks are available:

<table>
<tr><th>Check</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_asserts</td><td>Monitors the rate of various assert types</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_connections</td><td>Monitors the number of connections</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_collections</td><td>Monitors the collection size</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_counters</td><td>Monitors the number of MongoDB operations</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_flushing</td><td>Monitors the flush time</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_locks</td><td>Monitors the number of locks</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_mem</td><td>Monitors the resident, virtual and mapped memory</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_replica</td><td>Show replica information </td> </tr>
<tr> <td>mongodb_instance</td><td>Shows instance information</td> </tr>
</table>

Note:
If the MongoDB is running as a replica set most of the agent sections are sent to
a piggyback host named after the replication set. You can find the replica name
in the agent output under &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;{replicaname}&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.
So you need to create a host named {replicaname} and execute a service discovery.<br><br>
Reason:<br>
A MongoDB replica set consists of n-Hosts. All of these hosts have the mk_mongodb plugin installed.
There is a primary host in this replica set which sends the complete plugin information.
The secondary and arbiter hosts will only send a subset of this data.
Since the primary host might change over time, we cannot put all discovered services on
the current primary host. If the host changes to secondary mode later on, all services
would be gone.
