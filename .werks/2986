Text elements (message, comment, contact, etc.) of an event may contain <i>'</i> and <i>"</i>.
The previous Event Console had troubles evaluating these event. Some shell scripts even got stuck..

For example: <tt>TEXT=my"text</tt><br>
Shell script: <tt>echo $TEXT$ > /tmp/mylog</tt><br>
The actual command looks like <tt>echo my"text > /tmp/mylog</tt> -&gt; broken command.
