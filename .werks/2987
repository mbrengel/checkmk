Title: esx_vsphere_counters: Improved accuracy of all counter values
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1454407189
Class: fix

In the previous versions the esx_vsphere_counter checks only got
the last real time sample from the ESX system, which always represents
a fixed interval of 20 seconds.<br>
With this update the agent vsphere now queries the last n-samples.
The number of samples is determined out of the agents check interval.<br>
Some of the counter checks have been rewritten to handle the increased
amount of data. Most of the values are simply processed to an average value,
with the expection of the latency, which uses the maximum value.
