Title: New filter: "Hostname or Alias"
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1455208441
Class: feature

Previously you could either search for the hostname or the hostalias
with distinct filters. This new filter returns both matches, e.g
any hosts starting with 'server7' and any hostaliases with 'server7'.

The <i>Quicksearch</i> sidebar snapin also supports this new filter.
If you want to use it you need to edit the target view of the quicksearch,
usually <i>searchhost</i>, and replace the <i>Hostname</i> filter with the
<i>Hostname or Alias</i> filter. If both filters are active, you will only
get the hostnames on the quicksearch.<br>

Reason: <i>Hostname</i> AND <i>Hostname or Alias</i> results in <i>Just the hostname...</i>
