Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1457452277
Class: feature

In the ESX datasource program you can now set if used piggyback name is
taken from the ESX management view (most of the time an alias) or if the
actual hostname of the system should be used (if available).

The alias option is set as default.
