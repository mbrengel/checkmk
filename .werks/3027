Title: mtr (Matt's traceroute): New agent plugin
Level: 2
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1460642919
Class: feature

mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs in a single network diagnostic tool.
For further information have a look at the mtr manpage.

This plugin collects data for every hop to the destination address and creates a plethora
of performance values for round trip average, package loss and standard deviation.

Keep in mind that services for this new check require quite a large amount of RRD space, due to
the large number of performance values. Roughly ~23MB for 10 network hops to a target destination.
