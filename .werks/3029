Title: rule editor icon: fixed query of invalid livestatus column

The cmc.log file regularly showed <i>"Replacing non-existing column 'host_host_name' with null column"</i>
whenever a multisite page with icons was shown. Most of the time it had no effect and did not brake anything,
because the correct data was already queried through an other function. Nevertheless, this bug has been fixed.
