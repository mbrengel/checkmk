The snmp implementation on those devices is quite broken.
Querying an incomplete oid could lead to an unresponsive snmp interface.
This error automatically resolves after a few seconds.
However, the service discovery process is not willing to wait -> Service discovery fails.

This werk fixes the queried oid, by specifying its complete path.
