Class: fix

When using datasource programs, e.g. for checking by SSH, the Check_MK
process could be terminated by a reached timeout leaving the launched
subprocesses open. This might have caused in processes being too long
open, running and consuming resources.

The datasource program process and it's sub processes are now cleaned
up when a check timeout occures.
