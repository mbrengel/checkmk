Title: mk_jolokia: plugin now supports setting custom CAs for verifying server certificate as well as sending a client certificate
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1456137267
Class: feature

The CA can be set through the new configuration parameter "cert_path". This can also be set to None,
in which case the server certificate is not verified.
If cert_path is not set, the behaviour is identical to the old behaviour which is dependent on the
python version. Old python versions (not sure exactly, probably up to at least 2.5) ignored server
certificates, later versions checked against system-wide trusted CAs.

To send a client certificate, set "client_cert" and "client_key". The key can't be password
protected.

"mode" also supports a new option called "https". If this is set, the client certificate parameters
need to be set and no further authentication should be expected by the server.
