Title: zpool: new check to monitor usage of zfs pools
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

There is already a check (zfsget) to monitor usage of zfs mountpoints, but in complex setups where
the pools don't map 1:1 to mountpoints, the existing check doesn't give a correct picture of the
underlying pools.
