Title: added option to availability to include host alias in reports
Level: 1
Component: reporting
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1458056479
Class: feature

In addition to the new option to display the host alias, the option "do not display the host name"
now works in host availability views as well, but only if the alias is selected to be displayed. You still
can't have a table with only the availability column.
