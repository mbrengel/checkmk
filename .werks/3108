Title: network interface and switch port discovery rules can now be combined to dicover multiple sets of interfaces

Class: feature

Previously, multiple rules "network interface and switch port discovery" were merged and thus their
parameters overwritten or combined.
I.E. if one rule had "Match interface alias (regex)" and the other "Match interface description
(regex)" both those conditions had to apply for the interface to be discovered.

This has been changed so that only one of the supplied rules has to match for an interface to be
discovered and the visual parameters (i.e. "Pad port numbers with zeroes") of only that (first)
matching rule will apply.

This is an incompatible change in that if you have multiple rules apply for the same host already,
re-discovery may now produce different items. Without re-discovery, nothing will change.
