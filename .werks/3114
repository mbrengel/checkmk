Title: Linux and Windows agent can now encrypt their output
Level: 2
Component: core
Class: feature
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1459867428

This feature can be configured through
{{Host & Service Parameters|Access to agents|Encryption}}.
When {{Encryption for Agents}} is set to {{enforce}}
or {{enable}}, two things will happen:

LI:Baked Windows or Linux agents will be configured to encrypt their output
LI:Check_mk will be configured to try to decrypt output from agents.

In case of {{enable}} it will also accept
unencrypted output, in case of {{enforce}} it won't.

This change also affects real-time updates as these were already encrypted.
The passphrase configured for real-time updates will now only serve as a
default, agents with "Encryption" configured will use the same passphrase
for rt and regular updates.  Finally, it is now also possible to configure
real-time updates to be unencrypted.

All encryption happens with AES using 256 bit keys and CBC.

The new encryption feature is completely optional, the default behaviour for
everything (including real-time updates) is compatible with previous versions.
