Title: logwatch: made check cluster-able
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1

Class: feature

Previously, if one tried to cluster a logwatch-service, only log entries from one node would be
passed to the cluster.
Another problem was that when re-scheduling checks on a cluster, the same log messages were re-read
and transfered the the cluster log again.
Both these problems are fixed now.
