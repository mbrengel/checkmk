Title: mssql: fixed counter calculation when caching plugin output

Previously, the mssql plugin output could not be cached as counter calculations were based on the
time the output was interpreted and thus would produce incorrect results.
This has now been fixed by adding a timestamp from the mssql server to the agent output.
