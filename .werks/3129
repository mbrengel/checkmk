Title: new view and datasource containing the results of the last periodic discovery check
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1462277160
Class: feature

With this change, the results of the "Check_MK Discovery"-check can now be presented in their own
searchable, sortable and filterable view.
In addition the check was extended to also include information about services disabled through a
rule. This gives users with no access to wato the chance to see that those checks were intentionally
suppressed.
