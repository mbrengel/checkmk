Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

To setup mrpe checks that also display the age of the cache, use a line in mrpe.cfg like this:
LOAD   (interval=360:appendage=1)    /usr/bin/check_load

interval specifies the maximum cache age in seconds (here: 6 minutes) and appendage=1 instructs the
agent to append the cache age to the output.
