Title: solaris agent: fileinfo patterns that match a directory will no longer output items for the files in that directory
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1466508571

Please note that this behaviour was not intended and differed from other agents. The created items
are also incorrectly formatted so we assume no one used/wanted this.
