Title: Treat interface name '1' and '01' as identical when grouping interfaces
Level: 1

Class: fix

Problem was that in the discovery rule for creating interface groups you had
to specify <tt>01</tt> as item (just it appeared in the service), while the
actual check compared agains the index (<tt>1</tt>). Both are treated identical
now and in the rule you may specify either <tt>01</tt> or <tt>1</tt>.
