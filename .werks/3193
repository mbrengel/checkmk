Title: Fixed fake check results for hosts

Fake check results were handled in a slightly inconsistent way, now their
behavior exactly mirrors the processing of "real" check results, making the
resulting up/down host states less surprising.

Note that submitting a "down" result does not necessarily imply a "down"
host state: Depending on the state of its parents, the host in question
could go to the "unreachable" state, too.
