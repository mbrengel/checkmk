Title: Fixed shutdown of Nagios core with Livestatus module
Level: 1
Component: livestatus
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0i1

The Nagios core no longer hangs now during shutdown when the Livestatus
module is used. This resulted in a long delay before the core was finally
killed forcefully.
