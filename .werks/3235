Title: Unbreak COMMAND handling
Level: 1
Component: livestatus
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1456481971

Due to a recent bug, only the first of several COMMANDs piped into
livestatus was executed. This made e.g. replaying the output of cmcdump
impossible. This has been fixed now.
