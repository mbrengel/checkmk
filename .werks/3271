Title: New option in aggregation for tuning aggregation of downtimes
Level: 1
Component: bi

Class: feature

When computing the state 'in scheduled downtime' for an aggregate
first all leaf nodes that are within downtime are assumed CRIT and all others
OK. Then each aggregated node is assumed to be in downtime if the state
is CRIT under this assumption. You can change this to WARN now by checking
the new option {{Escalate downtimes based on aggregated WARN state}} in
the properties of an aggregation now. The influence of
this setting is especially relevant if you use aggregation functions of type <i>count</i>
and want the downtime information also escalated in case such a node would go into
WARN state.
