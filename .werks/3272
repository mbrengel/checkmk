Title: oracle_tablespaces: severity of check for autoextension is now configurable
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1458228140
Class: feature

There is now a new check parameter that defines the check state in case that
the current autoextension setting does not match the expected setting. The
expected setting is either determined during discovery (default) or by an
explicit value in the rule.

By setting the state in such a case to OK the checking for autoextension
is effectlivey turned off.

Since the expected autoextension setting and the severity are two different
parameters you can easily create independent rules for the expected setting
and the severity of a mismatch.
