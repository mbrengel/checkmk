When calling datasource programs for monitoring they are executed as subprocesses
of Check_MK. Check_MK as passing all filedescriptors except stdout and stderr to
the subprocess. So if a subprocess was doing something strange with them it could
happen that this influenced the handling within Check_MK.

This could, for example, confuse the communication between the CMC and the Check_MK
keepalive helper processes.
