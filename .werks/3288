Title: Implemented grouping of services in table views
Level: 1
Component: multisite

Class: feature

You can now configure the service table views to group the service row together
to expandable groups. This can be configured using the global setting
"Grouping of services in table views".

For example if you have a host with several network interfaces
which are all named like "Interface 1", "Interface 2" and so on, you can create
a single group out of them. You can name the group "Interfaces" and configure
a pattern like "Interface .*" for matching all your interface services. Once saved
you can open up the service list page of the host and see all interface services
hidden and grouped together.

Please note that only services in OK (and not stale) state are grouped together. If
one of the interfaces is in a problematic state, it will not be hidden by the grouping
mechanism.
