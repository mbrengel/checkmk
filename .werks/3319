Title: HW/SW-Inventory service can now be OK in case of unreachable host
Level: 2
Component: inv

Class: feature

The active check for performing the HW/SW-inventory used to always take the
WARN state if the inventory cannot be done (mostly because the target host
was down).  This can now be set other states as well. Set this to OK if you
inventorized workstations that are allowed to be switched off. This setting
is in the rule set {{Do hardware/software Inventory}}.
