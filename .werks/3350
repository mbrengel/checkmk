Title: Merged source of Event Console with Check_MK
Level: 1
Component: ec
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1459347597
Class: fix

This is more an internal cleanup than a thing you need to care about when you
are using the Check_MK Raw or Enterprise Edition. This is only interesting
for you if you are compiling Check_MK from source on your own using the
source packages.

We have merged the mkeventd-*.tar.gz into the check_mk-*.tar.gz. So if you
are trying to install Check_MK with the setup.sh you don't need to download
the Event Console package anymore.
