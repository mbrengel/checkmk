Class: fix

When using cached executin of local scripts or agent plugins (putting scripts
in subdirectories named like the execution interval) with the AIX agent, the
directory names were interpreted as minutes which was not consistent with the
other agents.

This has now been changed to be consistently interpreted as seconds. You will
have to rename your directories to the current name multiplied with 60 to
execute the plugins again in the expected interval.
