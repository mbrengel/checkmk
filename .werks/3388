Class: feature

The Event Console can now process SNMPv3 traps send with SNMPv3. To be able to receive
the traps, you will have to configure the SNMPv3 credentials to be used for decrypting
the received traps. This can be done in the Event Console configuration using the
option <i>Credentials for processing SNMPv3 traps</i>.

For each sending server you need to configure the credentials and the systems engine ID
which is normally generated automatically by the SNMP device. Some devices also support
setting engine IDs on your own. However, the SNMPv3 specification requires that each
SNMP device has it's own unique engine ID. To be able to decrypt the traps you need to
configure this engine ID together with the other SNMPv3 credentials for each trap sending
device.
