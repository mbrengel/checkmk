Event Console rules can now close the events they created by having
a specific syslog application in messages.

If the application of the message matches this regular expression 
(case insensitive) and either no text to cancel is specified or 
that text also matched, then events created by this rule will 
automatically be cancelled (if host, facility and match groups match).
