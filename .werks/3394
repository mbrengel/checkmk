Title: Availability: Annotations can now be used to reclassify the scheduled downtime status
Level: 2
Component: reporting

Class: feature

The availability computation of hosts and services now allows to use the
existing {{Annotations}} in order to reclassify the annotated periods as
having been in scheduled downtime or even as not having been in scheduled
downtime. That way you can fix your figures in case one has forgotten to enter
a scheduled downtime in the past or in the case that scheduled downtimes
were just used in order to disable notifications (but the breakdown was in
fact real and not scheduled).

Reclassification of downtimes on hosts and services also has an effect
on the availability of BI aggregations that are based on these objects.
