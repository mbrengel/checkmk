If you have created 1000 or more aggregations and show a view with many
hosts or services than you could get massive performance and memory problems
in your Apache process. The reason is the computation of the BI icon in the
drop down menus of hosts and services. This was only done in order to
check the visibility of the menu itself. The menu is now always visible
and thus the computation is not longer neccessary.
