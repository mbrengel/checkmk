Title: Change default setting of Precompile aggregations on demand to ON now

The global setting {{Precompile aggregations on demand}} improves the
performance of BI in case where not all aggregations are needed at once. This
is especially true for the case of single-host aggregations. This setting
now exists for a long time and we have finally regarded that feature as
stable enough in order to make it the default.

We might remove the setting from WATO totally in future.
