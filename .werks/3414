When declaring OIDs in SNMP based checks you can now include the OID
into <tt>BINARY</tt>.  This will then create a list of bytes instead of a
string. E.g. <tt>BINARY('5')</tt> will fetch the end OID 5 and convert the
string values into lists of bytes, into <tt>[0, 33, 85, 10, 7, 186]</tt>
instead of <tt>'\x00!U\n\x07\xba'</tt>. This allows to tackle a problem with
the new version 1.2.8 that otherwise automatically interpretes all strings
as UTF-8.
