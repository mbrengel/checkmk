Title: Fixed possible BI exception "Unknown BI aggregation group ..."

An exception has been fixed which could occur when using "multi host" aggregations
together with the "precompile on demand" feature. It could happen that a BI ajax
fold/unfold request was the first BI request in an apache process which had not
yet initialized the BI cache yet.
