Title: df: Fix displayed vertical range of graph of all filesystem checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

The graph recipe had an explicit vertical range of <tt>(0, 0)</tt>. That
effectively had set the displayed range to 0..1 Bytes/day - which led to an
always empty or near useless graph. This has been fixed.
