Title: Logwatch pages now work in distributed environment without HTTH reverse proxy
Level: 2
Component: multisite

Class: feature

The web pages for viewing and acknowledging files from logwatch checks now no longer
need a HTTP reverse proxy setup but simply work. The use Livestatus - just like the
other status data. This means that in the Enterprise Edition you can now drop the
reverse proxying totally. In the Raw Edition you still need it for the performance
graphs from PNP4Nagios.

In a manual setup you need to tell the Livestatus Nagios-Module where it finds
the logwatch files with the option <tt>mk_logwatch_path=.....</tt>. Specify the
absolute path to the base directory where Check_MK stores the logwatch files.
This path always ends with <tt>/logwatch</tt>.

Note: You need to update Livestatus / Check_MK on all remote sites. If you just
update the central site then the logwatch GUI will stop working.
