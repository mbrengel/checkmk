Title: The edit host and diagnostic page are now able to handle SNMPv3 credentials
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1

Class: feature

You can now set SNMPv3 credentials explicitly in the edit host page.
Furthermore the host diagnostic page now also supports the input of custom SNMPv3 credentials.

Please note that the SNMPv3 option <i>Credentials for SNMPv3 without authentication and privacy (noAuthNoPriv)</i>
is currently broken and will return no valid information. This will be fixed soon.
