Title: Added user login session idle timeout
Level: 2
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat

Class: feature

It is now possible to configure a login session idle timeout globally or for each user
individually. When a user logs in and leaves the GUI open without interacting with it,
Check_MK does not invalidate the users login session. The login is valid until the user
closes the window or logs out. With the new option enabled, it is possible to configure
a maximum allowed idle time after which each user has to renew the login.
