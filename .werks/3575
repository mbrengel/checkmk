Title: User logins can now be limited to a single session at a time
Level: 2

Class: feature

Normally a user can login to the GUI from unlimited number of clients at the
same time. If you want to enforce your users to be able to login only once
(from one client which means device and browser), you can enable this option.
When the user logs out or is inactive for the configured amount of time,
the session is invalidated automatically and the user has to log in again
from the current or another device.
