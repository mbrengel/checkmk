Title: check_mail: Fixed issue with processing multipart mails
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown

When the check is configured to forward mails to the Event Console,
it was unable to parse multipart mails. This has been fixed. The
events now get the contents of the first text/plain part added until
the configured body limit.
