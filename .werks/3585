Title: Implemented API for exporting the full host inventory

The HW/SW inventory data can now be exported using a webservice. This webservice
outputs the raw structured inventory data of a host.

The URL to this webservice is:

C+:
http://[MONITORING-SERVER]/[SITE]/check_mk/host_inv_api.py?host=[HOST]&output_format=json
C-:

You choose one of these output formats: <tt>json</tt>, <tt>xml</tt>, <tt>python</tt>.

The data provided by this webservice looks as follows:

C+:
{
    "result": {
        "hardware": {
            "memory": {
                "total_ram_usable": 16697331712,
                "total_swap": 17049841664,
                "total_vmalloc": 35184372087808
            }
        },
        "networking": {
            "hostname": "Klappspaten"
        }
    },
    "result_code": 0
}
C-:

The data below the key <tt>result</tt> is the HW/SW inventory data.

In case an error occurs during processing of the request, for example a host can not be found,
the <tt>result_code</tt> is set to 1 and the result contains the error message:

C+:
{"result": "Found no inventory data for this host.", "result_code": 1}
C-:


You can also request data of multiple hosts at once. In this case, you need to specify your request like this:

C+:
http://[MONITORING-SERVER]/[SITE]/check_mk/host_inv_api.py?request={"hosts": ["host1", "host2"]}&output_format=json
C-:

You will then get an answer that is similar to the answer above. With the difference that the top level dictionary
uses the host names as keys and the values are the inventory tree of this host.

C+:
{
    "result": {
        "gestern": {
            "hardware": {
                "memory": {
                    "total_ram_usable": 16697307136,
                    "total_swap": 17049841664,
                    "total_vmalloc": 35184372087808
                }
            },
            "networking": {
                "hostname": "Klappspaten"
            }
        },
        "heute": {
            "hardware": {
                "memory": {
                    "total_ram_usable": 16697307136,
                    "total_swap": 17049841664,
                    "total_vmalloc": 35184372087808
                }
            },
            "networking": {
                "hostname": "Klappspaten"
            }
        },
        "slave": {}
    },
    "result_code": 0
}

Another difference in this mode: When a host has no inventory data, the host has an empty dictionary as value
instead of providing an error result.


If you want to only have a subset of inventory data, you can specify a list of <i>inventory paths</i> which are then
used to filter the tree. Only hosts that have those paths will show the trees.

For example, if you only want to see the total and swap memory information of a single host, you can use the following URL:

C+:
http://[MONITORING-SERVER]/[SITE]/check_mk/host_inv_api.py?host=[HOST]&request={"paths": [".hardware.memory.total_ram_usable", ".hardware.memory.total_swap"]}&output_format=json
C-:

You will get back only the requested data:

C+:
{
    "result": {
        "": {
            "hardware": {
                "memory": {
                    "total_ram_usable": 16697307136,
                    "total_swap": 17049841664
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "result_code": 0
}
