Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

This makes it easier to create custom graphs based on bits/sec. If you have any
existing custom graphs that make use of <i>Input octets</i> or <i>Output octets</i>
then you need to replace those metrics with <i>Input bandwidth</i> or <i>Output bandwidth</i>.
