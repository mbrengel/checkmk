Title: Fixed check_mkevents active check.
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

check_mkevents didn't make sure that the whole request was sent. Furthermore,
it didn't shutdown the socket after sending the request.  This (or sending an
empty line) is necessary in recent versions of mkeventd.
