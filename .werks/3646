Title: Fixed Livestatus output formats
Level: 2
Component: livestatus
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1471512556
Class: fix

All Livestatus output formats handle special characters correctly now, including
non-ASCII characters, quotes, and backslashes.

There is one exception: To avoid compatibility problems, the default
<tt>csv</tt> format has been left unchanged and is still broken. A new format
<tt>CSV</tt> (note the uppercase) has been added which is fully functional and
therefore ignores the <tt>Separators:</tt> header/hack.

Furthermore, a new <tt>python3</tt> format has been added to handle the changed
default string type in Python 3, where bytestrings and Unicode strings have
basically swapped their roles.
