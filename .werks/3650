Title: Fixed bash versionitis, unbreaking cached check results.
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix

Our shebang lines in scripts explicitly state which bash they want, and the
bash instances we start from the script should better use the exact same
version.  If there is a version mismatch, lots of funny things can happen,
the most prominent being that caching check results doesn't work anymore
(e.g.  when using MRPE).  This is caused by the bash fixes for the
Shellshock vulnerability which change (among other things) how functions are
exported to sub-shells.  The consequence is that a pre-Shellshock bash
doesn't see the functions exported by a post-Shellshock bash, and vice
versa.  This setup can happen when the shebang and the user's PATH have
different ideas about which bash to use.
    
To fix this, we use the same absolute path for starting the bash
sub-processes as the one stated in the corresponding shebang.
