It is now possible to declare custom host attributes (just like for users). By default the
custom attributes are just fields in the configuration GUI which you can use to store
host related values in.

Each of the attributes can be configured to be exported as custom variable to the
monitoring core. In case you do this for a custom attribute, the variable will be available
in the monitoring GUI, in notifications and via raw livestatus for your scripts or 3rd party
tools.

If you create a custom variable "my_custom_variable", it will result in a custom variable
"_MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE" in the monitoring core.
