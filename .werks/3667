The host search in WATO is normally performing a case insensitive infix search on the
set text attributes (e.g. name, alias, IP addresses). Now you can specify regular expressions
by prefixing the search term with a <tt>~</tt>. The regex searches are also performed as
case insensitive infix searches.
