There are situations, when the agent is caching sections and the check
interval of a check is configured to a special value, that services will
become stale even when the agent could still send cached information.

For example the ntp section which is cached for 30 seconds, wen using a
check interval of 120 seconds, could become stale after 180 seconds when
the update of the agent cache takes more than 60 seconds. The agent would
then throw away the cache which is currently updated and return no ntp
section which results in a stale service then.

The fix is now, that in such a situation the agent is processing the old,
already cached, section and restarting the cache update immediately
(instead of the last run as it was before).
