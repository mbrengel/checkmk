The Event Console was not really supporting distributed setups in the past. In
case you have a setup of multiple sites you always had to decide whether or
not to setup a single, central, EC or one EC per site and how to handle and
configure monitoring and notifications.

The Event Console can now be integrated into distributed setups more
easily. The standard setup is now a single Event Console per site,
which receives the events of all hosts monitoringed with this site.

In case you have a central view site, the Event Console views show up the
events of all Event Console instances configured in the central site. You
can manage all the events of the remote Event Console just like managing
hosts and services of the remote site.
