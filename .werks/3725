Title: mssql_instance: Changed MSSQL monitoring to report connection issues with only one service
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1469709917
Class: feature

The MSSQL monitoring has been reworked to have one single service per database instance that
reports connection issues like a stopped database. This is done by the <tt>mssql_instance</tt>
check.

All other MSSQL checks have been reworked to become <i>stale</i> in case there is a connection
issue and no data is present.

As a result you will only receive one notification and see only the relevant issue in the GUI
in case an instance goes down.

To make this work you will have to update the <tt>mssql.vbs</tt> agent plugin on all your
database servers.
