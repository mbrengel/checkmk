Title: Automatically creating automation user for Check_MK internal use with WATO default config
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1469780006
Class: feature

We are adding now a default automation user named <i>cmkautomation</i> to Check_MK with the
WATO default configuration. This user will currently only be added to new sites, but may be
added to existing sites in future, too.

The user has the administrative role to be able to access all hosts and do all actions. The
authentication secret is randomly created for each site. In distributed setups the authentication
secret will be synchronized from the central site.

The idea of this user is, that components of Check_MK can automatically authenticate with
the Web GUI using an always existing user. This is currently not used, but may be used for
the internal cron job, fetching of graphs and performing checks against the GUI.

If you don't like this user, you are free to disable or delete it. But this may lead to issues
in future when we start using the user for internal things.
