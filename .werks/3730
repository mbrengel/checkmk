Class: fix

In case there are users using different languages in the GUI, the interface could load
slower since the GUI needs to re-initialize different code parts (multisite plugins) each
time a user with a different language accesses the GUI.

In technical detail: Each apache process has one Python interpreter which serves the
Check_MK GUI. Once a request arrives, the whole GUI code is loaded in the language
of the user. This loaded GUI is cached until a user with another language requests
a page from this apache process. The cache needs to be renewed then. This takes a
lot longer than simply using the cache.

We have now improved the situation by routing the requests to language dependent,
so called, sub interpreters. Each apache process can now have a default language 
(english) interpreter and an e.g. German language sub interpreter which each have
caches on their own and thus never need to reinitialze their cached GUI now.
