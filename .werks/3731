Title: sap.value-groups: Replaced this check with sap.value_groups
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1470057200
Class: fix

The old check name was not allowed because it contained a dash. The
check has now been renamed. You will get a warning message when the
old check is executed and only need to rediscover the services of
the affected hosts. You don't need to migrate anything here.
