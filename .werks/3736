In the {{Counting}} section of a rule the Event Console has now a new option
{{Discontinue counting after time as elapsed}}. Normally new messages matching
an existing open event that is configured for counting will simply increase
the counter and not open a new event.

When you activate the new option you can limit this phase to a certain
duration, e.g. to 10 minutes. Any messages arriving 10 minutes after the
first matching message will then open a new event instead of just increasing
the counter of the existing one.
