In some situations Check_MK would loose the cached IP addresses
in <tt>var/check_mk/ipaddresses.cache</tt>. The results in the
next activation of changes being very slow - depending on your
DNS. The problem seems to happen (especially) if you have activated
periodic service discovery with automatic activation of changes.

This has been fixed.
