Title: oracle_asm_diskgroup: Made check more robust against invalid data received from agent
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0i1

It may happen, at least with older version of the agent plugin, that the help text of SQLPlus
is sent in the agent sections. This could lead to ~50 services being created by accident. The
changed check now ignores these unexpected lines from the agent and only processes lines which
match the known format.
