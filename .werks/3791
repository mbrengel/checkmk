Title: f5_bigip_vserver: now reports lots of additional performance data
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1472026584
Class: feature

This check now reports the following performance data
<ul>
<li>The min, max and mean connection duration</li>
<li>The total connections and connections rate</li>
<li>Incoming and outgoing bytes packets</li>
<li>Packet velocity asic rate</li>
</ul>

This werk is marked as incompatible because of a small logic change.
If the vserver is not available and all of its children pool members
are down the check remains {OK} instead of {CRIT}.
