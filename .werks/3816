Title: WATO Web-API: fixed bug in API request validation
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1475146794
Class: fix

Recent code changes did not consider that only the keys of the request
object itself got validated. The validiation function now got feeded with
some additional keys, e.g effective_attributes, didn't accept these keys
and returned an "Invalid request" as result.

This has been fixed.
