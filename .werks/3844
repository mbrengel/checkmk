Title: Fixed validation of host IPv4, IPv6 and management host address attributes
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1472458101
Class: fix

The values inserted in the WATO host address fields were not validated strictly enough.
This has now been changed so that the IPv4 address field allows IPv4 addresses and host-
or DNS names and the IPv6 address field allos IPv6 address and host- or DNS names.
