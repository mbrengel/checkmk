Class: fix

Some host related files (caches, precompiled checks, counters, ...)
were not deleted when removing a host via WATO. This has now been
fixed. These files are removed once a host is deleted:

<ul>
<li>precompiled host checks (nagios)</li>
<li>discovered services</li>
<li>counters</li>
<li>agent / SNMP caches</li>
<li>persisted sections</li>
<li>piggyback data</li>
<li>HW/SW inventory caches</li>
<li>baked agents</li>
<li>logwatch files</li>
</ul>

The HW/SW inventory archive and performance data (RRDs) are not
cleaned up by this mechanism. To clean these files up, use the
disk space cleanup mechanism (see global settings).
