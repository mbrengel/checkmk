Title: Improved handling of Check_MK GUI request timeouts
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1473841576
Class: feature

In previous Check_MK versions, there was no real user friendly and correct
handling of too long web request processing. So if a user issued a request
to the Multisite GUI which took longer than the system apache request timeout,
it resulted in a default webserver error page showing a "proxy timeout" error
message.

Another issue: The timeout was dependent on your system apache configuration
and, if you did not change the settings on your own, on the Linux distribution
defaults.

We have now changed the timeout mechanism as follows:

The system apache process will end the communication with the client after
the timeout configured for the proxy connection from system apache to site
apache. This is done in /omd/sites/[site]/etc/apache/proxy-port.conf file
in the "timeout=x" parameter of the ProxyPass statement. The client timeout
has been configured to 120 seconds.

The application (Check_MK GUI) request timeout should always be lower than
the client timeout to make it possible to abort the page processing and send
a helpful response page to the client. The default timeout is set to 110
seconds.

Developer note:

It is possible to disable the applications request timeout (temoporarily)
or totally for specific calls, but the timeout to the client will always
be applied by the system webserver. So the client will always get a error
page while the site apache continues processing the request (until the
first try to write anything to the client) which will result in an
exception.
