Title: check_mail_loop.vbs: New MRPE script to perform a mail loop check via Outlook MAPI
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1474010004
Class: feature

The check is similar to the default check_mail_loop active check (which can be configured
via WATO), but it works using Outlook and the MAPI protocol to send and receive mails. So
you can construct a mail loop checking your Exchange mail infrastrucure without involving
other protocols like IMAP, POP3 or SMTP.

Take a look at the file header of the script. It describes how to setup the script.
