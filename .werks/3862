Title: mknotifyd mknotifyd.connection: New service description (when enabled)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1474206536
Class: fix

The checks were using an uncommon service description for their checks:

Notification Spooler [site] ...

Because those processes are logically tied to the OMD sites, it makes more
sense to make them match the other OMD site check naming scheme:

OMD [site] Notification Spooler

This has now been changed. It will automatically be applied to new sites.
Existing sites will only use this new description after enabling it via
Global Settings and performing a rediscovery of the services on the affected
hosts.
