Title: ipmi: new discovery rule and cleanup

IPMI sensors can be ignored by their status texts during discovery in single
mode.

This cleanup concerns the following configured discovery rule and will be
treated as follows: 'summary' mode remains contant but if you have additionally
configured 'ignored sensors' you have to use the new 'IPMI sensors' rule now.
This needs no rediscovery and can be configured during runtime.

All other cases are compatible with existing situations.
