Previously you could already configure contact groups in Event Console rules,
but those groups were only used to control the visibility of the events in
the GUI.

Now these groups can be used to control the visibility and also make them
relevant for the notifications created by the Event Console. Besides adding
the groups to the rule, you can configure whether or not to add the contact
groups to the notifications and also configure the precedence of the groups
in case there are host contact groups configured and event contact groups
in the rule.

Existing rules are treated as before. The contact groups of the rule will
not be added to the notifications until you open the rule, tick the checkbox
and save the rule again.
