It seems more practical to have slightly wider time ranges, e.g. 8 days instead of 7 days
to have a little more context. We also extended the "month" and "year" time ranges.

You have now the following available:

LI:The last 4 hours
LI:The last 25 hours
LI:The last 8 days
LI:The last 35 days
LI:The last 400 days
