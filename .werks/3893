Title: Predictive levels: Improved handling of broken prediction files (empty files)
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1475061250
Class: fix

In previous versions it could happen that the predictive levels feature created empty
(zero byte sized) files below var/check_mk/prediction which made the predictive levels
not work anymore for the affected service. This situation is now being repaired
automatically.
