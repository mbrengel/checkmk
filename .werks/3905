Title: barracuda_mailqueues, nullmailer_mailq, postfix_mailq, qmail_stats: these checks now have items, postfix can now monitor multi directories (linux agent)
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1475141806
Class: feature

If postfix is configured with multi directories then the linux agent provides information
about deferred and active mail queue length of these directories.

Note: The existing ruleset mailqueue length is now deprecated. These checks will
work further on but the related ruleset won't be applied any more except the default levels.
To make these new checks work, please
1. rediscover the affected hosts
2. use new mail queue length ruleset and
3. enable "use new service description" for these checks below global settings.
