Level: 2
Component: metrics

Class: feature

You can now customize the vertical axis scaling mode and mirror the
metrics in a graph if you like. This can be done just for yourself
or for all your users.

This can be useful, for example, if you like to change the scaling
of all CPU usage graphs from fixed 100% to dynamical scaling based
on the measured values.

This feature is usable for all template based and combined graphs.
It does not affect custom graphs at all.

To configure such a customization open your GUI and click the {{Edit}}
button of your {{Views}} snapin. Then click on the {{Graph tunings}}
button on the top of the page. From this page you can then create a
new graph tuning where you first need to set a title and the graph
type you want to customize
.
Then you need to add a new tuning setting where you can first configure
to which graphs you want it to be applied and then configure the options
you want to change.

If you like you can enable to share this tuning with others, which will
make your changes effective for other users graphs.

After saving the new tunings it's settings will be applied immediately
to fresh rendered graphs.
