Title: oracle_sessions: fixed bug with default absolute levels
Level: 1
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i2

Class: fix

When relative levels were given in a rule but no absolute levels, the default levels from the checkplugin still have been used. Now absolute levels are ignored by default if setting up a rule. This allows to set up a rule for only relative levels. This change is compatible to existing rules! Additionally defaults for absolute levels are still used if no rule is given.
