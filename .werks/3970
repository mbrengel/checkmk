Title: Fixed possible URL injection on index page
Level: 1
Component: multisite
Class: security
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0i2
Date: 1477295864

Till this version it was possible to inject authenticated users external URLs
as start URLs for their GUI.

An attacker could use this to make an authenticated GUI user open a page of his
choice when the user clicks on a prepared link.

One example URL which could be used: <tt>index.py?start_url=//heise.de</tt>

Thanks to Marcel Bilal for reporting the issue!
