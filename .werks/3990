Now uses xml instead of lxml. Unfortunaly lxml is not available in all distributions, so
we had to switch back to xml which is considerably slower in parsing xml messages.
You can try to install the python module lxml with the command "pip install lxml".


Now able to query counters smaller chunks. There were some bigger netapp clusters which
raised an out of memory error while answering the call. The reason was that the answer grew
too big. We now query smaller chunks and merge them together.


Now only queries relevant sections. Right at the beginning, the agent queries the available
licenses on the system and skips sections, which's licenses are specifically not enabled.
This feature is currently only implemented for a few section and will possibly improved later on.
