Title: agent_netapp / netapp_api_if: improved mechanism to collect interface infos. fixes invalid if-speed
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1480592904
Class: fix

The speed of most interface was not correctly determined.
This has been fixed by the new agent. You need to do a new service
discovery of the netapp systems. Otherwise the existing netapp_api_if
checks will raise a warning, stating that the speed differs.
