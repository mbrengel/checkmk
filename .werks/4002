Title: Speed up display of BI aggregations
Level: 2
Component: bi
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1481707801
Class: feature

Previously, each Apache process had to compile the all BI aggregation trees
by itself.  This generated lots of CPU load during core restart, especially
on larger BI configurations.

With this update, an Apache process no longer computes the BI trees only
for its own use.  The computation results are now shared between the
different processes through cache files.

If you encounter any bugs with this new mechanism you can switch back to the
old implementation via the global settings option <i>Use legacy compilation
for BI aggregations (slower)</i>.
