Title: agent_activemq: now able to provide BasicAuth credentials
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp

Class: feature

You can now set the username and password if your ActiveMQ Server requires Basic-Authentication.

Furthermore a typo has been fixed, which marks this werk as incompatible.
The item name has changed from <i>Actice_MQ</i> to <i>Active_MQ</i>, so you need
to start a new service discovery for these hosts.
