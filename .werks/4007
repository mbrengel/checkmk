Title: Windows Agent: Reduced number of needless WMI Queries when Skype performance counters are missing
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b1
Date: 1482313422
Class: feature

The windows agent now skips the processing of the skype section earlier, if the
performancecounters are not available. This presumably fixes an error where the windows
agents hangs in a followup WMI query.
