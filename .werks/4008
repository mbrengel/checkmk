Title: Windows Agent, dotnet_clrmemory section: prevent indefinite freeze of windows agent
Level: 1

Class: fix

The windows agent could freeze in the dotnet_clrmemory section while querying WMI counters.
This freeze is presumably caused by an earlier WMI query for the skype section which failed, due to a non-existing wmi counter.
