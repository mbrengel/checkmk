Title: Windows powershell scripts are now always called with the options -noprofile -executionpolicy bypass
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b1

Class: feature

The -noprofile option improves the startup of the powershell interpreter.
The "-executionpolicy bypass" means that the agent will no longer check any
signatures of powershell scripts, since we don't provide them in ps1 script, anyway.
