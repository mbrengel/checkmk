Title: mk_logwatch: plugin now also supports windows
Level: 2

Class: feature

The mk_logwatch plugin is no longer restricted to linux.
It now runs as a frozen python binary under windows, which requires no extra python installation.

The plugin reads its configuration from the config/logwatch.cfg file.
The syntax of the windows and linux logwatch.cfg is identical.

The plugin may be configured through the WATO agent bakery with the rule "Text logfiles (Linux, Windows)".
The former rule "Text logfiles (Windows)" still works, but is considered as deprecated.

Keep in mind, there is difference in regex pattern matching.
The legacy windows logwatch always did a case insenstive match.
The new mk_logwatch.exe now also checks case sensitive, just like the linux plugin.
