Previously when you didn't configure a From address for you email
notifications in {{Monitoring configuration|Notifications|Parameters for ASCII Email}}
or {{Parameters for HTML Email}} the email was created without a
From address and the local mail delivery agent added that address
by using its configuration or some default.

This cause a problem in the new synchronous STMP devlivery for emails, since
there a From address is required.

Check_MK does now not longer rely on the default of the system
mailer but always falls back to <tt>mysite@fqdn</tt>, where <tt>mysiste</tt>
is the name of the Check_MK instance and <tt>fqdn</tt> is the fully
qualified domain name of the monitoring host.

If the change in the From address causes a problem in your setup please
simply set a From address by creating a global configuration rule in the
upper settings.
