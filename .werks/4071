Title: Removed notes_url from "LOG *" logwatch services
Level: 1

Class: fix

In previous versions of Check_MK we created hard coded "notes URLs" for all services.
This was done to make the logwatch pages automatically linked from 3rd party GUIs
like the good old Nagios CGIs. These days we do not recommend nor support such GUIs,
so we decided to drop this pre-created notes url definition.

The "advantage" is now that you can now create a custom notes URL for these services.
