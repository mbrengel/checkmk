Title: Cleaned up cluster host handling in HW/SW inventory
Level: 1
Component: inv
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1480088542
Class: fix

Previously the manual inventory calls on the command line were
not possible on the command line, but when adding a "Check_MK inventory"
service to a cluster host, the inventory was tried and did work in case
the cluster has a host address configured.

These differences have now been cleaned up and changed a bit.

You can perform the inventory now on command line and add a "Check_MK inventory"
service to the hosts, but the regular inventory with all the plugins is not
performed against cluster hosts. Instead the clusters only get the following
inventory nodes added:

<ul>
<li>Software > Applications > Check_MK > Cluster > Cluster host: Yes</li>
<li>Software > Applications > Check_MK > Cluster > Nodes: List of nodes</li>
</ul>

The first node is also added to all other hosts but set to <i>No</i>. You
can then use a filter to include or exclude the hosts of your choice from
your inventory list views.
