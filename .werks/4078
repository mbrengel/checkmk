Title: Fixed handling of hosts with non resolvable IP addresses during runtime
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1480413611
Class: fix

Hosts which only have a hostname configured that IP address is resolved during
configuration creation. When a host could not be resolved it is added to the
monitoring with the 0.0.0.0 or :: address.

That lead to some checks monitoring the local host accidentally.
