Title: check_mk_agent.solaris: fixed run_cached function
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0b1

Previously the run_cached function simply exited if cache file $CACHEFILE.new was too old.
This has been fixed now, the function acts just like in the Linux agent - it removes the process of the file as well as the file itself.
