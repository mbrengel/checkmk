Title: Fix matching of hosts when forwarding notifications from Event Console

Up to now the host name in the event was looked for in the monitoring
data with an exact match. Now the same algorithm is being used as
in the GUI: case insensitive comparison of the event host name with
the monitoring host name, alias and IP address.
