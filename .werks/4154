Title: Do not send notifications if host found and currently in downtime

Class: feature

When you forward notifications from the Event Console to Check_MK then
from now on these are being suppressed if the host can be found in the
active monitoring and is currently in a scheduled downtime.

This is very much what users except and want to happen. Please note that
- however - this is an incompatible change sind now some notifications
will not longer be sent that have been sent previously.
