Title: Do not perform actions on events if overflow limit is active
Level: 2
Component: ec
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b1

Class: fix

If the EC blocks a new event because of an active overflow limit
then it now correctly also omit any configured actions (i.e.
a notification) on that event.

Previously actions would be executed anyway - that way undermining
the overflow protection. Furthermore the action "Send notifiction"
would run into an exception because of a missing event ID.
