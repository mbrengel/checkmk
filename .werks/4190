Title: mssql_blocked_sessions: Fixed unknown states if only one session is blocked
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b1
Date: 1486137493
Class: fix

The check state has been unknown if only one session was blocked, because
the checkplugin was expecting one additional first line from the agent output
which does not exist anymore. The new version can handle both cases and will
not accidentally drop any information anymore.
