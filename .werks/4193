Title: check_mail: Fixed bug with fetching mails
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b1

Class: fix

Previously the active check was not able to handle response messages containing
more information than expected. Additionally the check was not closing the
connection afterwards, so the messages never have been deleted.
