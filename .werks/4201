Title: mkeventd_status: avoid duplicate averaging, make graphs more precise in time resolution
Level: 1

Class: feature

By not using pre-averaged values anymore but switching to precise performance counters
the check now computes are precise average of the counted events (e.g. rule hits)
since the last check. This makes the graphs much more precise. It also makes a
reschedule of the check show more recent data.
