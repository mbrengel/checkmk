When computing the availability of a BI aggregation for a time range during
which new hosts or services were added to the monitoring the state of these
objects would be displayed as (PEND) before point of time they were added. But
this is not correct. These objects where not pending but simply not yet
existing and thus not contained in the aggregation tree at all at that time.

When computing a BI state it is a big difference if something is pending
or simply not existing. One pending node can make the total tree state also
(PEND).  While this is correct in the current monitoring it breaks the
availability computation.

BI availability has now been fixed so that unmonitored hosts and services
are correctly being removed from the tree in the according time ranges and
the real state at that time is reconstructed. That way bogus (PEND) phases
of BI aggregations are being avoided.
