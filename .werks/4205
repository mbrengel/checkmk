All views showing a selection of hosts or services now have the new
button {{Combined graphs}}. This will bring you to a new page where
all metrics graphs of these objects are being shown in a combined
way so that you can for example see all HTTP-metrics of certain
hosts in one graph. You can then choose of of the presentations
"stacked", "sum", "min", "max", "average" and "lines".

Such graphs can be added to graph collections and reports. They
also can be converted into custom graphs and then edited manually.
Addition to dashboards is not yet implemented but will follow soon.
