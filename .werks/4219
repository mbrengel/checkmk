Since several versions you can configure the Event Console to receive only SNMP traps having
specific SNMP communities set. Previous versions were simply processing all traps.

The community "public" was somehow special since traps with this community were accepted in
any cases. We have now changed the community public to just be accepted by default. In case
you add additional communities, these will also be accepted. But in the moment you remove
the public community, the traps containing this community will not be accepted anymore.
