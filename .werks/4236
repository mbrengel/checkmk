Title: Removed g_hostname and g_service_description from Check API
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1484066870
Class: fix

In previous versions the check and inventory plugins of Check_MK
could use the variable <tt>g_hostname</tt> to refer to the host
that is currently being checked and <tt>g_service_description</tt>
to get the description of the service that is currently being
checked.

Instead of those variables, you can now use the functions
<tt>host_name()</tt> and <tt>service_description()</tt>
