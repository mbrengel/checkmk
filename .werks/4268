Title: cisco_vpn_tunnel: Reporting zero traffic in case the tunnel is down
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.4.0b1
Date: 1484138387

Previous versions of the check were not providing any performance data in case
the tunnel was down. The graphs were showing flat lines for the time the tunnel
was down which could lead to confusions because in fact there was no traffic
at all.
