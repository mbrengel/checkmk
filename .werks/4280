Title: Interactive login is now denied for automation users

Class: fix

It was possible to log into the Check_MK GUI interactively (using the login form)
as automation user. This was never intended and was a bug. 

Automation users are only meant to authenticate with the GUI for a single page or API
call using the URL variables (<tt>_username</tt> and <tt>_secret</tt>).

In case you want to login interactively to access multiple pages, you need a "normal"
user that has a password configured instead of an automation secret.
