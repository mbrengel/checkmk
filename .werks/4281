Class: fix

It was possible for agent plugins / special agents to create piggyback hosts
with spaces in their names which lead to crashes of Check_MK check helpers
when trying to check these hosts.

These spaces will now automatically be replaced by underscores to workaround
this issue. In case you want to have another replacement logic, you can use
the piggyback translation ruleset to override the default behaviour.
