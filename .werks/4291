Title: mk_postgres, postgres_instances, postgres_bloat, postgres_conn_time, postgres_connections, postgres_locks, postgres_query_duration, postgres_sessions, postgres_stat_database, postgres_stats, postgres_version: plugin and checks are now instance aware

Now the {{mk_postgres}} agent plugin is instance aware. Moreover the new check
{{postgres_instances}} reports if instance is running or not. All other checks
go PEND if instance is not running.

The following lines describe the agent plugin configuration.
If you have default postgres installation it's not necessary to give a
configuration file, ie. if
- user is 'postgres' or 'pgsql' and
- PGDATABASE is 'postgres'

Configuration of the plugin is needed if you want to monitor multiple instances.
Then you have to determine
- database user
- path to instance env file
- user name for this instance
- path to .pgpass file where password is stored

This can be done via postgres.cfg file with following syntax:
DBUSER=DB_USER_NAME
INSTANCE=/home/postgres/INSTANCE1.env:USER_NAME:/PATH/TO/.pgpass
INSTANCE=/home/postgres/INSTANCE2.env:USER_NAME:/PATH/TO/.pgpass

It's incompatible because now the following checks need an item. Thus
the service descriptions will change.
- postgres_conn_time
- postgres_sessions
- postgres_version

Another reason is that {{postgres_sessions}} needs a new rule set
{{PostgreSQL Sessions}} which can handle items. The older one is
marked as {{deprecated}}. It is located below
{{WATO > Host & Service Parameters > Deprecated Rulesets}}.
You have to transfer these old rulesets to new ones which can be found below
{{WATO > Host & Service Parameters > Parameters for discovered services > PostgreSQL Sessions}}.
