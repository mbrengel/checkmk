Title: statgrab_disk: Works now in the same way as other diskstat check plugins
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0b1
Date: 1485251642
Class: feature

Reconstructed statgrab_disk check plugin: {{read}} and {{write}} values
will be handled in one service as in other diskstat check plugins.
Moreover the check has a discovery rule within which you can specify whether
a summary service or services for each disk are generated. Default is
summary mode.

In order to make the new check plugin work you have to perform a
re-discovery on the affected hosts.
