The service discovery dialog of hosts has completely been reworked. It has
been changed to be more user friendly and make bulk actions more comfortable.

We have reduced the number of columns, moved the action icons to the first
columns and made the checkboxes for bulk actions optional. Each table has
now it's own bulk actions. These actions are performed on all rows of the
table by default. If you enabled the checkboxes, the actions are performed
on the selected rows. The full scan button is now an action button like the
other actions.

Actions on that page will now make you stay on the page to see the result
of your action.

The disabling of services is now totally done via the "disabled services"
ruleset. For each host a host specific rule is added to this ruleset for
setting the disabled services you choose in the service discovery dialog. If
you have global rules that disable services and choose to enable that
service via the service discovery dialog, a "enable" rule is created for
the selected service.

This means the service discovery page creates up to two rules in "disabled
services" for each host, one positive and one negative rule. These rules
have the description "Discovery rule of '[hostname]'".
