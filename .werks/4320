Class: feature

It is now possible to configure site specific global settings for the central
master site in distributed setups. In previous versions it was difficult to
set a configuration setting (like the number of check helpers) for the master
site and another value for the remote sites. You had to set the configuration
setting for each site individually which could be a problem when having a lot
of remote sites.

With this change the "Global settings" can now be handled as default
configuration settings for all sites while the site specific settings can be
configured on the site specific globals page which can be opened from the
distributed configuration page.

So you can now easily set a individual setting for the master site and leave
the configuration for the slave sites at the global defaults.
