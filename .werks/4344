Fixed wrong value calculation for filesystem usage. Now the factor 1024
is used.

Removed the performance data for the filesystem usage and amount of files.

Reasons for this decision:
<ul>
  <li>Graphing system is not able to handle such kind of dynamic performance variables like
    <ul>
      <li>group_USERNAME_blocks</li>
      <li>group_USERNAME_files</li>
      <li>USERNAME_blocks</li>
      <li>USERNAME_files</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Generated graphs use the standard logarithmic scale for painting the filesystem usage.
      This view is not useful for the user and makes the handling complicated.</li>
</ul>

The check will work as expected and does not need further user modifications or configurations.
