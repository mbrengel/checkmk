In the past it was possible to delete virtual host trees by accident,
because the virtual host trees were identified by their number in the
list of trees.

The users were also referencing the trees by these IDs. When the trees
were re-sorted, the users suddenly had the wrong trees activated.

Now you have to provide a unique ID for each virtual host tree
