Title: Fixed enabling/disabling of notifications/active checks/passive checks

Changing various flags in an ad-hoc (i.e. non-rule-based) manner did not
work correctly: Changing a flag to a value different from the configurated
one worked, but trying to change it back to its configurated value had no
effect.  This affected the various Enable/Disable buttons on the
host/service details pages plus the corresponding Livestatus commands
(ENABLE_HOST_CHECK etc.).

Note that 1.2.8 versions and earlier are were not affected by this bug.
