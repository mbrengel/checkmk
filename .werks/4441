Title: mem: new configurable thresholds for "Estimated RAM for new processes"
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

Now thresholds for the graph "Estimated RAM for new processes" are
configureable. This is optional and will use the "MemAvailable" value,
which is part of meminfo since kernel version 3.14. This value will not be
checked on older kernel versions and thresholds will not be used even if a
rule has been set.

From kernel.org:
An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new
applications, without swapping. Calculated from MemFree,
SReclaimable, the size of the file LRU lists, and the low
watermarks in each zone.
The estimate takes into account that the system needs some
page cache to function well, and that not all reclaimable
slab will be reclaimable, due to items being in use. The
impact of those factors will vary from system to system.
