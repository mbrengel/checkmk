When configuring a rule, you can now set an optional message, which will be displayed
beside the rule result. In earlier versions, a rule result was <i>OK</i>, <i>CRIT</i>, etc.
The new option allows you to provide an additional text for each state.


So the result now may look like <i>CRIT, only 70% of servers are up</i>.


This additional information is also shown in the check plugins <i>check_bi_aggr</i> and <i>check_bi_locals.py</i>.
