Title: liveproxyd: fixed needless connection timeouts (site dead) when changing the site configuration
Level: 1
Component: liveproxy
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1490457827
Class: fix

Upon startup, the liveproxyd waited one heartbeat interval before making any attempts
to contact the remote sites. This has been fixed. Changes in the distributed monitoring
configuration should no longer result in longer fake "site dead" messages.

Note: This also improves the stability of BI aggregation checks which rely on a stable connection to the remote sites.
