Title: Windows Agent: Agent shutdown no longer stalls while plugin is running

The agent did not stop any running plugins when the shutdown command was issued
and waited for their completion. A "net stop check_mk_agent" could fail because of this behaviour.
The agent updater suffered from this too, because the MSI installer failed to stop the service in time.
