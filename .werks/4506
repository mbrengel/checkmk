When a user has the permission "see all events", he can see events for hosts that the user is not
permitted to in the status GUI. This is the default for regular users.

These users could access the event detail page and see information about the host, like the state
of the services, even when they were not permitted to see data about this host in the status page.

Whe the user is allowed to customize his views, he could easily add more host related columns to
see even more information about that host.
