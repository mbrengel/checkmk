Title: Removed agent configuration from debian package descriptions
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1490615882
Class: fix

The debian packages created by the agent bakery contained the whole
agent configuration. This could contain secrets that should not be
available with the description, e.g. when using the alert handlers.

The RPMs and Debian packages now have the same description.
