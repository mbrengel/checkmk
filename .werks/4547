Title: check_mk_agent.linux: Fixed agent section which spammed in utmp of RHEL/CentOS
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

The section postfix_mailq_status was writing into utmp everytime the agent
run. With the new version we are able to avoid this behaviour and still get
informations about multiple instances of postfix.

This fix needs an updated agent AND an updated checkplugin but a rediscovery
is not neccessary.
