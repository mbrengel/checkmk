Title: Vanilla agents (RPM/DEB) of latest releases did not contain recent changes
Level: 1

The prepacked vanilla agent which is found below ~/share/check_mk/agents as .deb or
.rpm files did only contain the changes shipped with the previous version. The fixes
added to the agents in the meantime between the versions were not included.

The packaging has now been fixed.
