The default encryption algorithm of htpasswd stores passwords
in MD5 format. If you take a look at the file it prefixes the
password with $apr1$. This format was not handled by the Check_MK
GUI. If you set the prefix to $1$ it worked.

The GUI has been changed to be able to work with both formats.
Passwords set with this command should now work out of the box:

htpasswd -m $OMD_ROOT/etc/htpasswd [username]
