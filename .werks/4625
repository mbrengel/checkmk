There has been a mistake causing an incorrect configuration for remote
instances. In the confiugration created by the agent bakery the information for
the piggyhost was missing. With this a connection could not be established,
because of the consequential errors. Also this error has always been present
since the bakery feature for oracle has been introduced.
