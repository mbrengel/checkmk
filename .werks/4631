Due to a change in the way SNMP is handled by Check_MK between
versions 1.2.6 and 1.2.8, OIDs representing the IP address of
the interface would now no longer be parsed (crash-free but
incorrectly) and crash. This has been fixed.
Re-discovery is required if and only if neither a description
nor a name had been used as an item before.
