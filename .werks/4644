Title: f5_bigip_mem: Improved Memory Check. Now also for TMM
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1494490116
Class: feature

As HR-MIB and UCD-MIB delivered incorrect information, F5 devices now have
their own checkplugin for memory. This includes also a separate Memory
Service for the TTM (Traffic Management Module). <b>Important</b>: This is
an incompatible change. You need to rediscover your services to remove the
hr_mem check and add the new f5_bigip_mem check.
