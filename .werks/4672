Title: Activation: Discard of changes is now possible again

The "discard changes" button which could be used to revert the pending
changes in WATO to the last activated configuration was removes during
1.4 development.

The main reason for this is that the snapshot feature of WATO is being
dropped and replaced in Check_MK 1.5 by some better mechanism.
