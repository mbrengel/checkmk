Title: WATO Web-API: now able to manage sites
Level: 2
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1495746521
Class: feature


You can now configure the WATO sites through new API calls

<ul>
<li>get_site: requires the site_id key in the request object</li>
<li>set_site: expects the same data format, than the get_site call provides.</li>
<li>delete_site: requires the site_id key in the request object</li>
<li>login_site: requires the site_id, the username and the password keys in the request object</li>
<li>logout_site: requires the site_id key in the request object</li>
</ul>


Important: Right now the interface is only able to speak the python language.<br>
The existing output_format parameter, as well as the new request parameter <tt>request_format</tt>
must both be set to <tt>python</tt>. An additional interface language is planned, maybe XML.
Furthermore, these API calls are intended for admin use only, since they might modify the entire
site configuration object.
