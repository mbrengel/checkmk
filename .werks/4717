When installing debian agent packages baked with the Check_MK Agent Bakery running on a SLES 12
server this could lead to this message during installation:

dpkg: error processing archive check-mk-agent_1.4.0b5-88de67ef934c3774_all.deb (--install):
 corrupted filesystem tarfile - corrupted package archive

Background information: The <tt>tar</tt> files built into the debian package were created with
a tar format that is not supported for the debian package format. We create the packages with
the <tt>gnu</tt> format now on all platforms.
