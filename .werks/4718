When the Check_MK helpers are configured with a higher log level than the default
Notice log level the Check_MK helpers were leaking memory. This can be configured
by changing the option "Check_MK check helpers" of the global setting "Logging of the core"
to e.g. Informational.

In this mode the helper gathers information about some changed variables during runtime
and the memory usage. It also allows to debug different mechanics of the helpers.

If you enabled this, each reload of the core (not restart) was triggering the memory
leak in the helpers. In extreme situations this could lead to duplication of the memory
usage on each reload.
