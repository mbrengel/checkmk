Title: wmi_cpuload: Added required tables to prevent crash
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Until now the checkplugin created Services only if there are potential
instancesi regardless if the needed information to compute these instances
is available. This has been fixed now - Services are only created, if all
necessary data is available.
