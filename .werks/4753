This change should be a performance improvement to reduce the load of the
sites webserver.

While a Check_MK GUI page is opened in the browser several parts are updating
themselfs in the background, for example sidebar snapins, dashlets and views.

A lot of users open several instances of the GUI in different browser tabs
(or windows) and leave them inactive in the background. They open different
tabs and keep the others in background or even leave their computer running
and just lock their user session.

In such situation the browser keeps updating the page elements even when no
one looks at the information.

We have now implemented a mechanism to detect whether or not a page is
visible or hidden to the user. In later case the updates are stopped until
the user opens the page again, then the updates are immediately done.

This change should be seamless for the user in most cases because the updates
are immediately done when the user focuses the page again, but it might happen
that you see a "grayed out" page for a short time. This grayed out page
visualizes that the information is outdated. If you should see this for several
seconds there is something wrong. But you can always tell your browser to
reload the page which should resolve this.
