Check_MK is using generic functions to perform file IO, for example to save configuration files
of WATO or saving the user properties of the GUI. With 1.4.0b1 we introduced a change that was
intended to prevent loss of just written files during hard OS crashes. This change has now
been reverted because it behaves badly in high IO load situations and might also itself cause
high IO load in case files are written in a high frequency.

The IO behaviour in this situation has now simply been changed back to the old state before
1.4.0b1.

In future releases (1.5+) we'll find a solution to improve the handling of OS crash recovery
situations.
