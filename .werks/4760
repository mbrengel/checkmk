When monitoring CUPS queues on linux systems using systemd it happened
that the agent did not provide CUPS queue information suddenly.

When using systemd the cupsd process is stopped when nothing is using
the daemon. Systemd is starting the daemon again automatically once
any process wants use the printer system.

The CUPS part of the Check_MK agent was only executed when the cupsd
process was running which is wrong for such systems. Additionally the
agent is now checking whether or not systemd is used and the cups.service
is enabled and checks the queues if so, even when the cupsd is not running.
