Title: Fixed multisite setups with sites using Check_MK/Livestatus < 1.4

When updating the central site of a distributed setup to Check_MK 1.4.* and
leaving the slave sites on older versions the other sites were marked as
dead sites while rendering the page.

This issue was caused by the tactical overview snapin that tried to calculate
the numbers for the "Events" of the Event Console. The slave sites using
older Check_MK versions do not support that kind of query. Once this query
is made the sites are marked as dead and are also not shown correctly in the
master control and site status snapin.

A possible workaround would be to update all involved sites to Check_MK
1.4.

Also affected are sites that use the Nagios core and have the Event Console
disabled. They still report an error to the GUI. This will be fixed soon.
