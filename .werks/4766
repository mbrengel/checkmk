Title: snmp_extended_info: Inventorizes all available physical components except ports in more robust way
Level: 1
Component: inv
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1496139584
Class: feature

Note: Some bogus devices such as Cisco WLC 2500 Series or
Cisco Wide Area Application Services either do not have exactly
one entry == "0" which means device itself or do not provide
any information about physical class.
In the first case {{Hardware > System}} will be omitted.
In the second case we inventorize these components below physical
components table {{Unknown entities}}.
In all cases ports are ignored because we have an extra view
for them.
