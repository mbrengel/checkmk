Title: oracle_locks: New SQL for check
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1497618876

The behavior of this check has been changed. There is no output
for object_owner and object_name anymore. This has been removed
for performance reasons. The check is moved from ASYNC to SYNC, due
to very easy SQL for getting the data. The problem with lot of wrong
alarms has been solved as well.

The old SQL is still existing for users who wants the object_owner
and object_name in check result. Please be aware that the old problems
are still there. Please make sure that the old check is configured
as ASYNC-Check. Otherwise you risk high performance issues in mk_oracle!

Please define the following lines in mk_oracle.cfg to get the old
behavior:
SYNC_SECTIONS="instance sessions logswitches undostat recovery_area processes recovery_status longactivesessions dataguard_stats performance"
ASYNC_SECTIONS="tablespaces rman jobs ts_quotas resumable locks_old"
