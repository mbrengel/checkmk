All parameters for discovered services, as well as manual checks, can now be assigned to specific timeperiods.
This makes it quite easy to configure exceptions, for example, when a data backup is running.
Each eligible WATO rule offers a button <i>Enable timespecific parameters</i>, which switches the rule into the timespecific mode.


In this mode you can configure a list of timeperiods and the related check parameters.
You can also configure a default check parameter, in case none of given the timeperiods matches.


The information, whether a timeperiod is active or not, is taken from the core during the check execution.
When the core is down/unreachable, the fall default check parameter will be used.
If a configured timeperiod name is not known, the default parameter will be used, too.
