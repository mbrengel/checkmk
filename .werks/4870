Starting point is having views with configured column
{{Service Graphs with Timerange Previews}}. Then in
{{Display options}} which modifies user specific options,
chosen {{Graph Timerange}} had no effects on displayed graphs.
The time range could be changed only with {{Set default time range}}
which is a subset of {{Graph Timerange}}.
