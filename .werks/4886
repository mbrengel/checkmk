URL prefixes are used for hyperlinks to Check_MK GUI so that
the recipient of the email can directly visit the host or
service in question in Check_MK.
These two new choices specify the URL prefix automatically.
If you're using more than one site this may be helpful in
order to avoid configuration of separate rules for each site.
