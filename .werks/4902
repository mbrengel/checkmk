A possible XSS issue has been fixed in the monitoring history views displaying the
plugin output of hosts or services. In case a host or service problem is being
acknowledged with HTML code in the acknowlegement comment, this HTML code  was
not being escaped properly when being displayed in the "plugin output" column.

Only authenticated users that are permitted to acknowledge host or service problems
could trigger this issue.
