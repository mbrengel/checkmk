Until now the solaris_mem has been prioritized over statgrab_mem if both are
available and deliver the same information. This has been changed by this
werk. Since the memory info from top is under suspicion to be buggy we do
prefer the mem information from statgrab from now on. The information from
top will be a fallback only if statgrab is not available.

You may have to rediscover services to benefit from this change.
