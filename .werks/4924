When cloning rules in a WATO ruleset you nearly always want to edit
the ruleset after cloning.

Previously you had to clone the rule, find the cloned rule in the list
again and open it for editing. This workflow has now been simplified:

Like in other places of WATO you now click on clone which opens up the
editor with the values of the origin rule. Once you save the editor
the rule will be saved with the just edited values.
