Title: Added missing host custom variables to notifications created by the EC

Class: fix

When creating notifications with the Event Console custom host attributes (HOST_*)
were not added to the notification context. In notifications created by the core
the attributes were available. This has been consolidated now, making the EC
notifications have variables like HOST_MYVAR when having a custom attribute named
MYVAR.
