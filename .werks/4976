Title: wmi_cpuload: Fixed UNKNOWN service state due to werk #4742
Level: 1
Component: checks

Some agent outputs do not include required sections 'computer_system'
and 'system_perf' and werk #4742 fixed that. But if required tables
are specified the wmi.include lib performed an intersection of these
tables. In case of wmi_cpuload check plugin 'system_perf' section
has only counters and comes together with 'computer_system' which has
table names and intersection of these tables would be empty.
Thus no service is discovered.
