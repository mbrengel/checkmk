Title: brocade_fcport: Fixed wrong speed information

Brocade specific SNMP table
.1.3.6.1.4.1.1588.2.1.1.1.6.2.1
does not provide speed information for the interfaces.
Thus this check plugins had to fetch another SNMP table
.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.15
from IF-MIB.
Unfortunately these tables are not directly connected by index
and the assumed speed information could be wrong for some
devices.

http://community.brocade.com/t5/Fibre-Channel-SAN/SNMP-FC-port-speed/td-p/64980
says that "1073741824" from if-table correlates with index 1 from
brocade-if-table.
