Class: feature

With the new ruleset {{Translation of service descriptions}}
service descriptions can be translated similar to the ruleset
{{Hostname translation for piggybacked hosts}}.
Services such as "Check_MK", "Check_MK Agent","Check_MK Discovery",
"Check_MK inventory" and "Check_MK HW/SW Inventory" are excluded.

Attention:
<ul>
<li>Downtimes and other configured rules which match these
services have to be adapted eg. the ruleset {{Disabled services}}. They fit
old service descriptions.</li>
<li>Performance data and graphs will begin from scratch for translated services.</li>
<li>Especially configured check parameters keep their functionality further on.</li>
<li>This new ruleset translates also the item part of a service description.
This means that after such a translation the item may be gone but is used in the
conditions of the parameters further on if any parameters are configured.
This might be confusing.</li>
</ul>

This rule should only be configured in the early stages.
