Title: f5_bigip_mem.tmm: Fixed discovery warning on command line if TMM information is not provided by the device
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre

Class: fix

The service has not been created and no impact could be noticed in WATO. But on
command line a warning showed up that there is an esception during discovering
services based on that check. This has been fixed now.
