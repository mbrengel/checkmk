Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: feature

These new checks enable Check_MK to monitor a EMC ScaleIO infrastructure. Take
a look into the manpages for further and detailed information.

It is recommended to install the needed plugin on all MDM members and
configure a cluster host in Check_MK, as the information is only provided
by the active MDM. All ScaleIO Services should be mapped to this cluster host.
