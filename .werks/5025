Title: Make communication with smartping helpers more robust
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1501763656
Class: fix

When the communication between the Micro Core and the smartping helpers
(icmpsender/icmpreceiver) fails, we restart the latter, but we forgot to
flush an internal buffer.  In some cases this could lead to more
communication problems later. This has been fixed.
