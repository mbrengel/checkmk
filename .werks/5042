Title: Removed export of WATO folder permissions to NagVis

Class: fix

In previous versions it was possible to export the WATO folder
permissions of each user to NagVis. This was only used for maps
that are named exactly like the WATO folder name. If you don't
have such NagVis maps you are not affected by this change.

This feature has never been documented officially, 

It was disabled by default and could be enabled with the global
setting "Export WATO folder permissions".

When having a large amount of users (1000+) and/or a bigger folder
hierarchy while having the global setting enabled this lead to
a huge performance impact when editing several things in WATO
(users, roles, groups, ...) and during activation of changes.

In case you really used this feature, you now need to configure
the permissions manually e.g. by defining contact groups and
giving them permissions on the NagVis maps (via WATO).
