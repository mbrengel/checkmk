Title: EC views: Fixed "Events of host X" views of unrelated events
Level: 1
Component: ec

Class: fix

When clicking on the host name of an unrelated event (one that has no host in the monitoring core)
the target page was not showing any event since Check_MK 1.4. The events are now correctly filtered
by the original event host instead of the host name of the found core host.
