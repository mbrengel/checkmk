Title: Fixed backup/restore of encrypted backups

It was not possible to perform encrypted backups since version 1.4.0b5. An error
message "NotImplementedError("Use module Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP insteadâ€œ)" was
displayed in the log when trying to create such a backup.

Workaround: Disable encrypted backups and perform unencrypted ones.

Encrypted backups created with previous versions need to be restored with 1.4.0b4
or older.
