Class: fix

The SNMPv3 contextes configured for a host were not used correctly for the SNMP-GET
request made during service discovery. This has been fixed now. When a single OID
is requested by Check_MK all configured contextes for a check will be queried until
an answer is recevied using a context. e.g. in case you have configured two contextes
for a check, the first configured context will be queried first. In case it answers
with the OID, this value will be used. In case the requested OID does not exist in
this context, the next contex will be queried.

The check independent OIDs .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 and .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0 will always
be queried without context.
