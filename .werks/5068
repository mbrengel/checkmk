When you create a report in a distributed environment with multiple sites
and not all of the sites are reachable when the report is being created
then there was simply missing data without any further notice.

Now if there was a problem with at least one site during the report creation
at the start of the report there will be inserted an extra page with an
error message. That way the reader knows that the data might be incomplete.
