This check parses the information provided by the SUSEConnect command.
If the command is availible, information about the registration status,
subscription status, subscription type, registration code as well as the
start and end date of the SLES license are shown. The information is
also shown in the Hardware/Software Inventory.

As a preparation you need to install the agent plugin {SUSEConnect}
into your agent's plugins directory (usually {/usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins}).

The check can be configured via the corresponding WATO rule {SLES License}.
