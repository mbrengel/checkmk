Title: Removed TMPFS configuration option

Class: fix

The "omd config" setting TMPFS, which could be used to disable the ramdisk that is mounted
below /omd/sites/[site]/tmp, has been removed now. The option was added for rare situations
where you could not create/mount ramdisks via tmpfs.

Because not using a tmpfs could result in loss of performance we remove this setting now. In
case you really need sites without tmpfs, please let us know.
