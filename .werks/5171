Class: fix

Removed the DEFAULT_GUI configuration option from "omd config". It was meant to switch
between different available GUIs in original OMD. In the current Check_MK packages only
a single GUI is supported, that is the Check_MK default GUI. It is now enabled for all
Check_MK sites.

This change made some small performance improvements regarding the initial HTTP redirects
possible. In case you acces http://host/[site]/ two redirects were made in the past. This
has been reduced to a single redirect.
