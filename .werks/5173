The OMD configuration options that are used to configure basic aspects of
the Check_MK sites can now be configured via WATO. The settings are available
via "WATO > Global settings > Site Management".

These settings are activated during regular activate changes similar to the
other configuration settings.

It is also possible to set site specific option via the site specific global
settings.
