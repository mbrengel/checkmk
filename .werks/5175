Class: feature

When enabling livestatus access via TCP (via "omd config" or the WATO site management)
it is now possible to restrict the access to a set of client IP addresses.

The new option has been added to the global setting "Access to Livestatus via TCP" which
then sets the "omd config" option LIVESTATUS_TCP_ONLY_FROM.
