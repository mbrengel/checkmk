Previously only the CMC understood the Livestatus command LOG.  This works
for the Nagios core now, too.

Note: For technical reasons the command is available under the name _LOG,
too, when the Nagios core is used, but this name is discouraged when using
Livestatus.  On the other hand: If you use the Nagios command pipe, you have
to use _LOG.  This tiny inconsistency is a bit unfortunate, but it is caused
by the way how Nagios handles custom commands.
