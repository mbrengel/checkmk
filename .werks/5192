Class: feature

Previously only 4 operators were available for filtering list-valued
columns:

<ul>
   <li><tt>=</tt>: checks that the list is empty</li>
   <li><tt>!=</tt>: checks that the list is non-empty</li>
   <li><tt>&lt;</tt>: checks that an element is not contained in the list using equality</li>
   <li><tt>&gt;=</tt>: checks that an element is contained in the list using equality</li>
</ul>

6 new operators have been added:

<ul>
   <li><tt>&lt;=</tt>: checks that an element is contained in the list using case-insensitive equality</li>
   <li><tt>&gt;</tt>: checks that an element is not contained in the list using case-insensitive equality</li>
   <li><tt>~</tt>: checks that an element is contained in the list using a substring regex match</li>
   <li><tt>!~</tt>: checks that an element is not contained in the list using a substring regex match</li>
   <li><tt>~~</tt>: checks that an element is contained in the list using a case-insensitive substring regex match</li>
   <li><tt>!~~</tt>: checks that an element is not contained in the list using a case-insensitive substring regex match</li>
</ul>
