When performing a bulk discovery on more than 40 hosts an error with
this message could occur:

"Error during discovery: Maximum number of retries reached. You need to restart the bulk service discovery"

After this fix you should be able to perform bulk discoveries with a lot
larger number of hosts. The limitating factor (limited number of transaction ids)
has been removed.
