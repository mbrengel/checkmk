To get a better view on the locally modified global settings it is now
possible to filter the list of global settings to show only the modified
ones.

This affects the following places:

<ul>
    <li>global settings</li>
    <li>site specific global settings</li>
    <li>event console settings</li>
</ul>

When the filtering is enabled, each page only shows the settings that
have been modified on this page. E.g. the site specific global settings
page only shows modified settings that are set specific for this site.
