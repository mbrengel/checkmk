Title: Checkgroup humidity: Fix swapped lower levels and definition of only one kind of levels
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1510751624

Previously, all checks of the checkgroup humidity would crash if only lower or only upper levels
were configured. Lower levels configured in the GUI would be swapped in the check, ie the
warn level would be interpreted as the crit level and vice versa. This has been fixed.
