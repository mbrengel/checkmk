Per default, most of the config files are now no longer written in pretty printed format.
You can switch back to the old format with the configuration option <tt>Pretty-Print configuration files</tt>.
Keep in mind that pretty printing configuration files may cost some cpu time, especially on larger installations
with hundreds of hosts, contactgroups or hosttags.
