The cmk-update-agent.exe plugin is now executed within the temp directory,
to prevent some <tt>permission denied on file</tt> issues during the update process.


Furthermore, the windows agent now generates additional agent out for the agent updater check,
whenever the cmk-update-agent.exe script fails to start.
