The file <tt>/etc/check_mk/real_time_checks.cfg</tt> now supports the parameter
<tt>RTC_PLUGINS</tt> which allows the configuration of plugins to be also executed
as real time checks.


For example<br>
RTC_PLUGINS+="apache_status"<br>
RTC_PLUGINS+="lvm"


This executes both plugins as real time checks (1sec resolution) in addition to the standard check.
