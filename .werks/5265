Title: cmk-update-agent: Enable Agent Updater to update itself on Windows
Level: 2
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i2
Date: 1512997920
Class: fix

When triggering an update under Windows, the agent updater could not be replaced by its new downloaded version because it was still running from the corresponding file.

This situation is now mitigated by restarting the agent updater from within ../temp when running from plugins-dir.

This is relevant only for a manual execution of cmk-update-agent.exe
