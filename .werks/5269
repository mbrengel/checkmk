Title: cmk-update-agent: New show-config mode
Level: 2
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i3
Date: 1515154865
Class: feature

With this werk, a new debugging-feature gets added to the cmk-update-agent(.exe) executable.

You can now display the current configuration and state saved within the cmk-update-agent.cfg and cmk-update-agent.state files.
Please note that the configuration file is prioritized over the state file and only effective configurations will be shown. E.g. a saved Check_MK server from state file will be shadowed by a configured server from cfg file and hence it will not be shown by the show-config mode.

You can invoke the show-config mode by running "cmk-update-agent(.exe) show-config"
