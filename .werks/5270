Title: Improved Agent Updater Check behaviour for Linux Hosts
Level: 1
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i3
Date: 1516085347
Class: feature

This werk only applies to the Linux Agent.

Formerly, the Agent Updater Check did not update immediately after a manual action on the host. This could lead to some confusion.
Notably, you had to wait for the next update cycle to have a successful Agent registration displayed within the Check.


In order to mitigate this situation, the Agent Updater now:

- Invalidates the cache file age after registration in order to have an Update executed with next Check_MK Agent execution

- Updates the cachefile information after a successful manual update.

The latter action is not performed in --debug option mode.


Information about the cachefile updates will be displayed in -vv mode
