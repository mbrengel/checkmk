Title: cmk-update-agent: prevent saving state file to wrong directory on windows

The Agent Updater would accidently save its cmk-update-agent.state to C:\etc if this directory was existant.
This could lead to an implausible update state. Virtually the Agent Updater would lose its registration information.

After an update or a manual reinstallation to a newly baked agent, a new registration might be required. 

However, you might want to delete the cmk-update-agent.state located at C:\etc after the problem has been fixed.
