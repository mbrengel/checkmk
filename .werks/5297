WATO groups, inventory functions in wmi.include and service descriptions
were inconsistent.
<ul>
<li>Werk 4099 changed WATO item type.</li>
<li>Library {{wmi.include}} returned wrong item for {{wmi_cpuload}}.</li>
<li>Check {{dotnet_clrmemory}} had not '%s' in service description (not incomp.).</li>
</ul>
In the first case the existing rules must be discharged and new ones have
to be applied.
Second issue requires a re-discovery on the affected hosts.
Third one is not incompatible; just a cosmetic change.
