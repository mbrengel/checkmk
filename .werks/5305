Title: check_mk_agent.hpux: Fixed path for Plugins and local checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1508765713
Class: fix

The original path for lib files has been hardcoded to omd version 0.45. The
scripts are now executed from the expected location which is standard for
linux and solaris. This results in a changed path for local and regular
plugins for the agent.

If the agent will be replaced by this new version, the new paths are:

local checks:
Old: /omd/versions/0.45.20110123/lib/check_mk_agent/local
New: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/local

plugins:
OLD: /omd/versions/0.45.20110123/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
New: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
