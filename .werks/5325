Title: mssql_counters.cache_hits: Discover services for which the agent plugins does not provide any base for the counter 'cache_hits'

Some base values for counters might be zero or None
if they are currently not available, eg.
MSSQL_FOOBAR:Databases log_cache_hit_ratio ANY-PATH 0
MSSQL_FOOBAR:Databases log_cache_hit_ratio_base ANY-PATH 0
This may lead to a flapping state of the
{{Check_MK Discovery Service}} which reports vanished services.
