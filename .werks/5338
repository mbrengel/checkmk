This werk adds the possibility to define date variables in the file
fileinfo.cfg either directly or via the corresponding rule Count,
size and age of files. Date variables can be used on linux and solaris
hosts and have the form $DATE:format-spec$ where format-spec is a list
of time format directives of the unix date command. Example:
$DATE:%Y%m%d$ is todays date in the format YYYYMMDD.
Using this option the agent will only send files containing the
current date. Date variables can be used together with the rules
File Grouping Patterns and Size, age count of file groups to monitor
if files are created in a directory on a dayly basis. Note that the
option Only check during the folling times of the day should be set.
Otherwise a warning may be displayed if the file of the current day
is not present yet.
