Title: check_http: Use HTTPS instead of HTTP in service description for SSL/TLS connections
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1509024010
Class: feature

For Check HTTP checks the service description now uses HTTPS instead of
HTTP if a connection via SSL/TLS is used. This makes it easy to distinguish
if a Check uses HTTP or HTTPS for a connection.

This feature is automatically enabled for new Check_MK installations.
If you upgrade an existing Check_MK installation you have to enable it
in the global settings via the option "Use new service descriptions"
in the section "Execution of checks". Be aware that the change may effect
existing rules, performance data (if present), and the availability
history.
