Class: feature

This werk moves information from the existing emcvnx_info check into new subchecks
for configuration settings, IO statistics, management port information, and storage
processor information. Additionally, the check emcvnx_agent is added. It contains
information about the devices that the destination Unisphere agent controls.
This information was included in in emcvnx_info as well.

Furthermore the info check now returns {CRIT} if the System Fault LED is on, the
management port subcheck returns {CRIT} if the link is down, and the IO check
returns {CRIT} if there are any hard errors.

To use these new checks a service rediscovery on the affected hosts will be
necessary.
