Fixed two situation where disabling of services did not work correctly:

<ul>
    <li>When a specific disable services rule was existing but not applying to the host,
        because it was located in a non parent folder.</li>
    <li>When a specific disable services rule was existing in a partent folder of the
        host and not in the same folder as the host.</li>
</ul>
