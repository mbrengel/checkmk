In distributed environments it could happen that all configured hosts are monitored
from all configured sites.

The now fixed issue was triggered by saving (adding/editing/removing) custom host attributes
using the "WATO > Hosts > Custom host attributes" dialog.

Background: This editing step was undeclaring the internal "site" attribute by accident
and rewriting all hosts.mk files. These files were missing the "site:..." host tag in the
all_hosts data structure. This makes all sites think that they are responsible for these
hosts.

The configured site information of the hosts/folders was not lost because it was retained
in the host_attributes data strucuture. So the hosts.mk files could be "repaired" by
saving the hosts, parent folders or host tags.
