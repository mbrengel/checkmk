Title: MySQL agent plugin: With agent bakery it's now possible to use a local mysql config file
Level: 1
Component: checks

By default the mk_mysql agent plugin is using the /etc/check_mk/mysql.cfg configuration file
to load the configuration set in the agent bakery. This file is under control of the bakery
and may not be modified by the user locally.

It is now possible to include an optional file that the user is allowed to store and modify
locally. This may be useful in case on wants to put the agent under bakery control, but
don't want to store the database credentials in the bakery. Instead of that the credentials
can be put into this file manually.

The new file is loaded from the same directory as the mysql.cfg and it must be named
mysql.local.cfg. When using the default paths, the full path is: 
<tt>/etc/check_mk/mysql.local.cfg</tt>.
