The monitoring cores Nagios and Microcore where treating "fake check results"
that can be sent from the GUI differently.

These fake check results are in fact passive host checks. From these passive host
checks Nagios simply takes over the reported state and uses it as new host state,
ignoring the parent logic. The microcore takes the parent logic into account and
may change a DOWN check result to UNREACHABLE when all parents are down.

We have now changed the configuration option <tt>translate_passive_host_checks</tt>
of Nagios to be enabled by default to make Nagios also check this logic.
