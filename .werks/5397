Title: Microcore can now be configured to send UNREACHABLE notifications
Level: 2
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i1

Class: feature

Normally you don't want to receive UNREACHABLE notifications of hosts. Configuring
client/parent relationships between your hosts is a good idea to be able to 
detect network outages. DOWN states of hosts will then be translated into UNREACHABLE,
making your view clear for the real cause (e.g. a router in DOWN state).

But there may be situations where you want to be able to receive these UNREACHABLE
notifications. This was already configurable when using the Nagios core for a long
time. For the Microcore the suppression of UNREACHABLE notifications was hard coded.
This has been changed now.

The default behaviour will not be changed. New sites or updates sites will not send
out UNREACHABLE notifications by default. To enable the new feature, you will first
have to tell the core to send out UNREACHABLE notifications.

To have a seamless transition we additionally changed these things:

<ul>
<li>A default rule that disables the UNREACHABLE notifications is being created
    for new sites in the ruleset "Notified events for hosts". Whenever you want
    to enable UNREACHABLE notifications, simply enable them using this rule.</li>
<li>Updated sites:
    <ul>
        <li>If you have configured rules for all your hosts in the
        "Notified events for hosts" ruleset, the core will continue working
        as configured.</li>
        <li>Microcore: For hosts that have no matching rule in "Notified events for hosts",
        the Microcore will <i>not send</i> out UNREACHABLE notifications.</li>
        <li>Microcore: If you previously had configured a rule in "Notified events for hosts"
        which enabled the UNREACHABLE notifications, this rule had no effect. It will now
        be working after updating.</li>
        <li>Nagios: For hosts that have no matching rule in "Notified events for hosts",
        the Nagios core will <i>send</i> out UNREACHABLE notifications.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
