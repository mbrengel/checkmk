It is now possible to configure the tuning settings of the rrdcached via
WATO (Global Settings > Site Management > RRDCached tuning).

This option is often changed to tune the disk IO behavious of the RRDCached. Details
about this can be found here: http://mathias-kettner.de/cms_graphing.html

The option can be configured globally for all sites or in the site specific globals,
depending on your needs.

The default values of the options are read from the existing configuration files
(etc/rrdcached.conf and etc/rrdcached.d/*.conf).
