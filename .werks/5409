Title: Windows eventlog: wrong last state saved
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
State: unknown
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1509376514

The initial run of Windows agent after fresh installation caused an
incorrect last state to be written in the state file eventstate.txt.
As a result, no new entries were read from the eventlog. Broken since
commit 91797ac9f7d69fc94119c08ea0df4baccaea2b6.
