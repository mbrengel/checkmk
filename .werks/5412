Windows logfile patterns have required a wildcard '*' at the end in
order to work correctly. It was not possible to require an exact match
to the end of a line without wildcard '*' at the end. The reason was a
carriage-return (CR) character at the end of each read line that
prevented a match unless a '*' was present at the end of the pattern.

Now also patterns without a wildcard '*' at the end work correctly.
