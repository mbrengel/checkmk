The name of the WMI class
Win32_PerfRawData_MSExchangeAvailabilityService_MSExchangeAvailabilityService
was misspelled. As a result, the Exchange Availability Service was broken in
all versions since 1.4.0. The misspelled name was introduced by the
refactoring done in commit c5ee818358e695b01c2f2dbc05ad0713723a37f8.
