This concerns the RAW edition or users which use CEE/CME edition of Check_MK
with deactivated inline SNMP.

When executing SNMP commands like get, getnext, walk or bulkwalk to get agent data
from hosts it may happen that these commands remain open as zombie processes.
Check_MK has been extended to deal with this situation and clean up these processes.

Details: When the command execution takes too long Check_MK sends a SIGTERM to the
process group of the executed program. After sending the signal Check_MK is now
waiting for the process to finish.
