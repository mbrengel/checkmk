Class: fix

Some host/service columns (check_command, notes, notes_url, action_url,
icon_image) can contain macros, and they have a corresponding "..._expanded"
column with those macros already expanded.  Previously, it was not possible
to use filters on those expanded columns when the Nagios core was used.
This has been fixed.
