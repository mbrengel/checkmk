Using wait objects on some tables (hostsbygroup, servicesbygroup,
servicesbyhostgroup) doesn't really make sense: Hosts and services can be
part of many groups, so we would have to conjure up a random group out of
thin air.  Consequently, we forbid wait objects on these tables now. 
Previously, the monitoring core crashed when we would try to wait on such an
object, anyway.
