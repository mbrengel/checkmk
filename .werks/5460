Note: This change only affects users writing their own tools for the
Livestatus interface, and only those tools which rely on an edge case.

Up to now, Livestatus had a special obscure case: Using a WaitTrigger header
in a query without a WaitCondition header resulted in waiting for the
trigger exactly once.  This is a misfeature, because it is effectively
useless and doesn't do what one might expect: Due to spurious wakeups
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spurious_wakeup), waiting might return
earlier basically at any time.

To fix this behaviour, the special case has been removed, and a missing
WaitCondition always has its expected semantics (always true) now.  Note
that this is consistent with a missing Filter header, which means "no
filtering".
