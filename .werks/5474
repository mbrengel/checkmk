Title: Revocery notifications have at least notification number 1

When periodic notifications were off, recovery notifications were sent out
with notification number 0.  This is different from what nagios does and it
is inconsistent: Recovery notifications should have the same notification
number as their corresponding problem notification.  This has been fixed,
the recovery notification numbers are now always at least 1, perhaps greater
in case of periodic notifications.
