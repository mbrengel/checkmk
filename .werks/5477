Prevously, you could only specify a point in time when a rule-based
recurring downtime starts.  You can now optionally specify an additional
point in time when no new downtimes will be started for such a rule, i.e. 
effectively disabling that rule from that point onwards.

Note that specifying such an end point is not possible for ad-hoc downtimes,
i.e. the ones entered directly without rules.  This is caused by the
underlying Nagios-compatible external commands which don't know such a
field.  Simply extending the commands by adding such a field is not a
reliable option: In multi-site environments you can have a mix of monitoring
cores and don't know which site uses which core.
