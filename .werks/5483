Title: mknotifyd: improve error handling and logging
Level: 1
Component: notifications
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0i2
Date: 1513152210
Class: fix

Connections in progress are now explicitely written to
the mknotifyd.log. This makes it easier to spot ongoning,
unsucessful connection attempts.

Furthermore, in case of polling errors a timeout of 1s
was added. This prevents the mknotifyd from using 100% CPU
if an error appears and the polling returns immediately.
