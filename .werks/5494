Title: nfsmounts, cifsmounts: increase timeout of nfsmounts and deliver correct status details
Level: 1

Class: fix

The waiting time of nfsmounts was increased to prevent agent timeouts.
Furthermore, the common check function was rewritten to deliver correct error
messages in the status details. E.g. a timeout in the agent now shows the
message "Server not responding" instead of "Stale fs handle".
