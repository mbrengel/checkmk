Title: logwatch: Fix exception in WATO's check parameter display

Previously, WATO's check parameter display would complain about invalid check parameters,
due to logwatch's parameter precompilation working well with the check itself, but
breaking the GUI's validation. This was a purely cosmetic issue.
