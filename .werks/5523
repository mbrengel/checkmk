Previously, the only way to influence the filesystem types to be ignored was by
setting a config variable manually in a file, which would affect the behaviour
globally. Now, this can be configured by a rule, allowing to include e.g. tmpfs
only for certain hosts. Individual mountpoints can also be configured to be
discovered regardless of filesystem type.
