Title: check_dns: Do not pass off the host's IP address as a default DNS server address
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix

Previously, in case of the DNS server address not being specified, Check_MK would
fill it in with the host's IP address, causing the check to time out. This has been fixed.

Thanks to Björn Müller for the patch!
