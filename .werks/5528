Title: Fixed showing help when executing "omd" without mode argument (1.4.0p18 regression)
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0i1
Date: 1510923599
Class: fix

With 1.4.0p18 the output of the help text when executing the "omd" command without argument
broke. It printed an exception instead of the help text. As workaround you can execute
"omd help" to get the help text.
