The new WATO page "Analzye configuration" is meant to give you hints about your Check_MK installation
and the things you could improve in terms of performance, reliabilty and security.

In the moment you open the page, it starts analyzing your Check_MK installation and executes
different tests. Test may detect that a thing is OK and report the test to be OK. Other
tests may result in WARN state in case you could be interested in changing something.
Other tests may report a CRIT state in case we think that you have a critical situation which
should be fixed for a completely working Check_MK setup.

Please note that this feature and the implemented tests are still in an early phase of
development. Understand the test results as pointer on things you should check.

Each of the tests can be acknowledged just for a single site or all your sites. In case you
came to the decision that a reported problem is not really a problem for you, you can
acknowledge the test results.

In case you fix a problem, you won't need to acknowledge it. Just open up the page again,
which should then turn your test into OK.
