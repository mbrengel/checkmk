Previously the GUI was loading all graphs in the progress of
rendering a view. The view was rendered to the user once the
information for all graphs is known. This mechanism made pages
that show a lot of graphs load slowly.

With this change the views are now rendered with a place holder
for each graph which is a lot faster. After the view has been
loaded for the user, the browser starts to render the graphs
asynchronously and simultaneously which will also reduce the
total time needed for loading.
