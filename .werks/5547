Exceptions in pre-activate-changes hooks, that one can register to extend the WATO functionality
before loading changes into the monitoring core were suppressed and only shown to the user if
the debug mode of the GUI is enabled.

These issues are now shown to the user during activation of a site in form of a short exception
message. The full trace is shown in the var/log/web.log of the site the error happens on.
