Title: reporting: Fixed unreasonable high timeout for availability elements

The option "Query Time Limit" is not available for the availability element
in reports and is instead hardcoded. The value has originally been set to
5*60*3600 (300 hrs) but should have been to 5 minutes. This bug has always
been in this element and is fixed as of now.
