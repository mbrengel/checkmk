The configuration options introduced with #5173 (Set OMD config via WATO) had
to be renamed. This is mostly an internal change, but you may have set one
of these options in a site using a daily master snapshot or the 1.5.0i1
version. Renaming the settings will reset your already configured settings
to default.
