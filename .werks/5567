Title: Scheduled reports can now be stored in the site

Class: feature

Instead of sending an email with the created report in the scheduled
interval it is now possible to store the just created reports locally
in the site.

This feature is configured in the configuration of the schedule. You
can now choose the action <i>Store locally</i> instead of
<i>Send via Email</i> and configure different action specific things
after this.

Each user allowed to use the report scheduler can open the page
"Scheduler > Stored reports" to view and open all stored reports
available to the user.

All reports are stored below <tt>~/var/check_mk/reports/archive/</tt>.

In the first directory below the base directory each user that creates
such stored reports gets a directory. All stored reports of this user
are saved below this directory. In case the user configures a schedule
to publish the resulting PDFs to other users, the reports are stored
in the <tt>public</tt> sub directory. A schedule can be configured
to store the report either directly in these directories or in a
hierarchy of subdirectories below these parent directories.

You can configure stored reports to be deleted after a given time.
