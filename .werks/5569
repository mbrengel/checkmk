The styling of the Check_MK graphs has now been unified for the most
places where the graphs are rendered:

<ul>
<li>Regular graph dashlets</li>
<li>Custom graph dashlets</li>
<li>Graphs in views</li>
<li>Graphs in reports</li>
</ul>

These standard render options are now available:

<ul>
<li>Font size</li>
<li>Title (Show, show inline, hide)</li>
<li>Add host/service information to title</li>
<li>Show time range of graph (top right)</li>
<li>Show margin round the graph</li>
<li>Show graph legend</li>
<li>Show vertical axis</li>
<li>Show time axis</li>
<li>Show graph controls</li>
<li>Show pin</li>
<li>Show previews</li>
<li>Colors (Background, foreground, canvas)</li>
</ul>

Some of these options are specific for the medium they are rendered
on. For example the graph controls are not available in graphs rendered
in reports. These options are hidden from the configuration.
