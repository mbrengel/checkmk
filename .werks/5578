Title: Fixed process locking (pid file handling)

Class: fix

The PID file handling of the Event Console had the following issues:

  a) The locking was only done by the init script. Manual executions
     could lead to multiple running EC processes. This has been fixed
     by adding an additional file lock to the PID file.
  b) The PID file was only removed in case the EC stopped without
     exception. In case one happened, the PID file was left over
     refering to the old PID.
