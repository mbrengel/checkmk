Class: fix

During the shutdown/restart procedure of the livestatus proxy
daemon a deadlock could occur. It seems this could rarely happen
when the system running the process is under high load together
with a large number of sites (>100) configured.

When this situation occures, you can see several left over
liveproxyd processes (master + several site processes) which
can only be terminated with SIGKILL. When looking at the processes
with strace, you can see hanging futex() calls.

Workaround: In such a situation it is safe to simply kill all those
processes using SIGKILL and start a clean liveproxyd processes after
that.
