You're able to restrict contact groups to see certain inventory tree
paths and attributes.
First go to inventory tree and enable 'Show internal tree paths' in
the display options in order to see the internal tree paths.
Below 'Permissions', 'Permitted HW/SW inventory paths' in the
configuration of any contact group you can register these internal
paths and attributes.

Consider the following exceptions:
- By default all contact groups are allowed to see the whole tree
- If one user is not part of any group this user is allowed to see
  the whole tree
- 'Allowed to see the whole tree' takes first priority.
- 'Forbid to see any path' takes lowest priority.

Examples:
- 'Allowed to see the whole tree' is configured in one group and
  'Allowed to see following paths' in another group, then
  the user is allowed to see the whole tree.
- 'Allowed to see the whole tree' is configured in one group and
  'Forbid to see any path' in another group, then
  the user is allowed to see the whole tree.
- 'Allowed to see following paths' is configured in one group and
 'Forbid to see any path' is another group,
  the user is allowed to see the configured paths.
