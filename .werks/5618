Title: skype.sip_stack: Fixed "missing key" error which caused a check crash
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

Above error was a result of different key notations for
the same object, eg. in "skype.sip_stack" we got
- "SIP - Incoming Responses Dropped /Sec" and
- "SIP - Incoming Responses Dropped/sec"
Now we normalize these keys by ignoring upper/lower
case and spaces.
