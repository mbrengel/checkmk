In the host properties you can configure extra IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
below 'Address'. Within the rule 'Check hosts with PING (ICMP Echo Request)'
you can choose 'PING all IPv4 addresses', 'PING all IPv6 addresses',
'Ping additional IPv4 addresses' or 'Ping additional IPv6 addresses'
below 'Alternative address to ping'.

Note that the active check ICMP can ping multiple IP addresses which have
to be of the same type. That means if you want to ping

- only IPv4 addresses, use
  'PING all IPv4 addresses' or 'Ping additional IPv4 addresses' in the check
  configuration.

- only IPv6 addresses, use
  'PING all IPv6 addresses' or 'Ping additional IPv6 addresses' in the check
  configuration.

- both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, you have to configure two active checks.
