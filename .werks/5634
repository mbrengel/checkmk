The Check_MK Microcore may need a long time for completing stop/restart of the
process waiting for currently running operations to finish.

One possible situation was that the Check_MK check helpers currently execute
checks in form of SNMP queries. A common case is that the helpers wait for
the response of a SNMP device which may take up to minutes, depending on the
"SNMP timing settings".

We have now changed the logic that these SNMP queries are terminated which
leads to an immediately ending Check_MK check helper and also a faster ending
Microcore process.

This change is especially important for cluster setups that have a tight
timeout configured for the stop operation of the OMD sites. With this change
the failover situations should be handled a lot faster and more stable.
