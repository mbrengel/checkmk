Title: omd stop/start: Add new option to execute site actions simultaneously

Class: fix

When having a larger number of sites an "omd start" or "omd stop" operation
may take a lot of time since all processes are handles sequentially. To improve
the overall execution time we have now added the optional -p/--parallel arguments
to handle the site actions simultaneously.

This change has mainly been made to fix long running overall startup / stop times
caused when having a lot of sites on a single system. This can be a problem
especially in clustered environments.
