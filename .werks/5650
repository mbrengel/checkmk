Class: fix

The service discovery page of WATO was showing a warning message
"Service discovery failed for this host: The check type filter function has not been set "
and no discovery could be performed for this host using the GUI
anymore.

Workaround: Use the discovery mode on the command line via <tt>cmk -II [HOSTNAME]</tt>.
