Using the new report element "Host report for multiple hosts" it is now
possible to include reports in other reports to instanciate it multiple
times.

For example you can now create a top-level "ESX host" report that
contains sub reports for each of your ESX servers.

All you need to do is to create a report that contains all the report elements
you want to see for a single ESX server. Either the whole report or at least
the single elements in that report need to have the "single host context"
configured. Then you need to create a top level report, add the element
"Host report for multiple hosts" to this report and select the previously
configured host specific report as child report. In that element you also
need to configure the "Search filters" to match the hosts you want to create
the child elements for. In the example above you need to configure e.g. the
host tag filter to select the ESX hosts.
