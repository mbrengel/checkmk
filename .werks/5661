Views and also dashboards can be published to members of contact groups. Earlier versions
allowed even normal users to select any configured contact group to publish these things to.

We have changed this now for normal monitoring users. They can now only select contact groups
which they are a member of. If you need the old behaviour back, you can enable the permission
"Publish views to foreign contact groups" for them.

Administators have this permission by default and can still publish views/dashboards to the
members of any contact group.
