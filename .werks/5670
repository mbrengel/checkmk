Title: Handle history files from older EC versions, which have fewer columns.

Class: fix

History files written by older versions of the EC might contain fewer
columns than a newer EC handles.  This fix fills these missing columns with
their default values, avoiding log messages like

   unknown precedence '' in table eventconsolehistory

in cmc.log later.
