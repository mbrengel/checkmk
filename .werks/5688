Title: Windows agent: numerous fixes to only_from

The setting only_from was handled improperly in many ways:

 * The IPv4 loopback address 127.0.0.1 did not always work in
   only_from, depending on what kind of client was used on localhost.
   Now if the IPv4 loopback address is given in only_from, the
   corresponding IPv6 loopback ::1 is added there to ensure the correct
   functionality with different clients on localhost.
 * IPv6 addresses converted from only_from IPv4 addresses were not
   output in section Check_MK. This was a regression from 1.2.8
   introduced in the huge refactoring
   c5ee818358e695b01c2f2dbc05ad0713723a37f8.
 * IPv6 addresses were output incorrectly in section Check_MK:
   * the last colon-separated group was always missing.
   * the groups were output as decimal instead of hexadecimal digits.
   * the groups were output in network byte order instead of host byte
     order, leading to incorrect output.
