Title: Windows agent: space in MRPE plugin path resulted in wrong plugin name

If the path of a(n included) MRPE plugin contained one or more spaces,
the plugin name was parsed incorrectly. Quotes were incorrectly
required for the whole command line including parameters within quotes,
making it impossible to distinguish between a script path containing
space(s) and space-separated script parameters. Now the MRPE plugin
path must be enclosed in double quotes (") in order to be processed
correctly. The same applies for script parameters with whitespace:
also they must be separately enclosed in quotes.

Example:

check_mk.ini:

[mrpe]
    include = C:\Temp\my.cfg


C:\Temp\my.cfg:

check = Dummy "C:\Program Files (x86)\check_mk\mrpe\check_crit.bat" some parameter "with space"
