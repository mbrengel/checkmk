Werk #5410 fixed a number of problems related to section Skype. It also
enabled the agent to run further than it was earlier capable of and
revealed some other old problems, this crash, among others. The extent
of the problem is not exactly known but it is likely that the crash was
restricted to some Windows versions only, at least Windows Server 2012
R2 was having the crash under certain circumstances.
