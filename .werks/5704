Title: Windows agent: prevent crash without IPv6 support

Class: fix

Windows agent crashed on older systems (at least Windows Server 2003 and
Windows XP) that only supported IPv4.

The bug was introduced in 1.4.0p25. Older releases and systems that
support IPv6 should have remained unaffected.

The configuration option ipv6 was not obeyed. Now this option can be
set to 'no' in order to only listen IPv4 connections on a IPv6 capable
system.
