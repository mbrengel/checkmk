Title: Restore support for 32 bit Windows
Level: 1
Component: checks

Class: fix

Support for at least older 32 bit Windows versions was accidentally
dropped in 1.5.0i1. As a result, an error about missing procedure in
ntdll.dll was shown. Now the support is restored and the Windows agent
should work correctly also on all 32 bit systems.
