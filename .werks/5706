Title: Windows agent: fix endianness of IP addresses
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: incomp
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0b1
Date: 1520326089
Class: fix

The string conversion of IP addresses was falsely done manually in
network byte order, resulting in incorrect ouput for IPv6 addresses.
Now the conversion is done correctly.

This fix will shortly break the compatibility of logwatch state files
stored by the mk_logwatch plugin of previous versions of the Windows
agent as they use the remote IP address(es) of the monitoring host(s).
When upgrading to the new agent, those log entries that are created
exactly after stopping the old agent but before starting the new agent
will be lost in monitoring. After starting the new agent, monitoring
should work as before.
