There is either a global defaukt start URL for fresh logged in users set
in Check_MK. It is either <tt>dashboard.py</tt> by default or customized
using the global settings. There is also a user attribute to customize
this setting for each user individually.

The idea of this setting was to set the start URL attribute only in case 
one wanted to override the global setting. But the attribute was set to
<tt>dashboard.py</tt> during creation of each new user, since the attribute
was not an optional one. If one then tried to change the global setting
it had no effect on the users, because they had all the start URL set to
<tt>dashboard.py</tt> individually.

This option has been made optionally now. It defaults to
<i>Use the default start URL</i> for new users.
