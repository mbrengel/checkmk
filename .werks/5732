The configuration if the BI aggregations is now handled in a customer aware
way by the Check_MK Managed Services Edition. You can now configure each
aggregation to be associated with a customer, the provider or being globally
available. The aggregations are assigned to the provider by default.

In case you want to have an aggregation only be synchronized to a single
customer, you can configure it in the aggregation properties.

A customer only get's the BI packs and BI rules synchronized that are
needed to handle the aggregations that are made available to this customer.
