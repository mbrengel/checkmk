Title: LDAP: It's now possible to create user accounts only on first login

Class: feature

The LDAP connections can now be configured to create user accounts only on
demand which means the accounts are created during the first login of the
user.

This feature can be used if you need to allow a large base of users to access
Check_MK, but only want to have the accounts of users created that really work
with it.

Please note that you will only be able to configure the users after their
first login. For example the roles / groups of a user can only be configured
after account creation.

It can be enabled using the option <i>Create users only on login</i> in
the <i>Users</i> options of your LDAP connection.
