Title: handle deferred notification properly

Class: fix

After the first retry deferred notification did not respect the cooldown time
defined in the global settings anymore. Furthermore the counting of the
configured retries was not done properly. If e.g. a retry count of one was
specified actually three retries were performed. These two issues have now
been fixed.
