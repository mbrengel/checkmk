Title: df.include: Fixed dynamic levels in ruleset 'Filesystem (used space and growth)'
Level: 1
Component: checks
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre

When configuring dynamic levels, eg. for filesystems, if you configure
the dynamic levels for example like this:

larger than 100GB: 90% WARN / 95% CRIT
larger than 1TB: 95% WARN / 98% CRIT

This will result in all filesystems smaller than 100GB in always being OK.
If you also want to set levels for all filesystems smaller than 100GB
then you have to choose 0 bytes, eg.

larger than 0B: 85% WARN / 90% CRIT

With werk 2725 this was not allowed any more. Fixed that.
