Title: ucs_bladecenter_fans.temp: Made item name unique

The check plugins {{ucs_bladecenter_fans.temp}} and
{{ucs_bladecenter_psu.chassis_temp}} created same
item names and both use the WATO ruleset {{Temperature}}.
That means that if a rule applied to a service generated
by one of these check plugins, this rule automatically
applied to the related one, too. No distinction was possible.

You have to perform a rediscovery on the affected hosts.
Performance data will be preserved.

Example:
ucs_bladecenter_fans.temp generated the services
- Temperature Ambient Chassis 1 FAN
- Temperature Ambient Chassis 2 FAN

and ucs_bladecenter_psu.chassis_temp generated the services
- Temperature Ambient Chassis 1
- Temperature Ambient Chassis 2

the item names were {{Ambient Chassis 1}} and {{Ambient Chassis 2}}
in both cases. The temperature rule matching the sensor ID
{{Ambient Chassis.*}} automatically applied to all four services.

Now the item names for
ucs_bladecenter_fans.temp look like
- {{Ambient Chassis 1 FAN}}
- {{Ambient Chassis 2 FAN}}

and for ucs_bladecenter_psu.chassis_temp
- {{Ambient Chassis 1}}
- {{Ambient Chassis 2}}

Independent rules may be created in the following order:
- {{Ambient Chassis.*FAN}}
- {{Ambient Chassis.*}}
