Title: Check_MK Update Agent: Now automatically repairs missing agent plugins after a failed windows agent update

On some occassions, the windows agent may loose its agent plugins during an msi update.
This issue is still being investigated. In the meantime, the cmk-update-agent.exe is now able to detect
a failed installation and tries to repair the missing plugin files.

Keep in mind that this workaround is only available -after- the next agent update, so the initial rollout
of this update may still fail, since it is done by an earlier version of the agent updater.
