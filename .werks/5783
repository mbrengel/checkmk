Class: feature

A new mechanism has been introduced allowing certain tasks to be run as background processes.
Currently the following areas are included
<ul>
<li>Host renaming</li>
<li>Agent baking (Enterprise Edition)</li>
<li>Report generation (Enterprise Edition)</li>
</ul>

Once a background job is triggered, an overview page provides additional information
regarding the progress. You can also stop and delete background jobs, if applicable.
Keep in mind that some jobs - in detail host renaming and agent baking - lock certain areas
in WATO to prevent further configurations as long the background process is running.

Each background has a working directory located in <tt>~/var/check_mk/background_jobs</tt> with
a statusfile named <tt>jobstatus.mk</tt>. If the background job generates stdout data it will
be shown in the job details page. Job Exceptions are also shown in the details page and, in addition,
written to <tt>~/var/log/web.log</tt>.

Keep in mind, old background jobs will be automatically removed after 30 days or if the maximum amount
of jobs for a job type has been reached. These limits are currently not configurable and hardcoded
<ul>
<li>Reporting has a limit of 100</li>
<li>Host renaming has a limit of 50</li>
</ul>
This cleanup routine is regularly called through a multisite cronjob.
