Title: Fixed race condition in counter computation if a host uses real time checks
Level: 1
Component: checks
Compatible: compat
Edition: cee
Version: 1.5.0b1
Date: 1521798371
Class: fix

There was a risk that the counter data for the Check_MK checks could get lost or reset
to an earlier state, when the host received regular updates through the realtime check mechanism.
This has been fixed. As a side effect, the counter data is now only saved back to disk when there were
actual changes.
