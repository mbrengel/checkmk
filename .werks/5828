Title: Handle case-insensitive equality correctly in Livestatus.

Class: fix

Equality-based Livestatus filters did not handle case-insensitivity
correctly for non-ASCII characters. This has been fixed.

The affected operators are =~ and !=~ for string-valued columns plus > and
<= for list-valued columns.

Note that regular expressions already handle case-(in)sensitivity correctly
since werk 5672 ("Use RE2 regular expression engine for Livestatus
queries").
