Disjunctions (Or:, WaitConditionOr:, StatsOr:) were handled like conjuctions
(And:, WaitConditionAnd:, StatsAnd:) when time ranges were calculated for
the log and statehist tables. This has been fixed now.

Note that the Check_MK GUI does not create such queries, so only people
using hand-rolled queries in scripts etc. were affected.
