SNMP credentials for management board that were set on folders were not
inherited to hosts.

The credentials can now also be set to "No explicit credentials" to disable
the inheritance of credentials for a host. The host will then either use
the SNMP credentials set in the ruleset "Management board config" or
use the default SNMP community "public".
