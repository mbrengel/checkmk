Title: Removed PYTHONPATH from site environment
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0b1

Class: fix

The PYTHONPATH environment variable which was set by omd and .profile for all processes
in the site was confusing external Python based tools like for example gdb or the command
not found helpers of Ubuntu. This resulted in confusing stack traces.

The PYTHONPATH needed to be set in previous versions to make the python environment know
about the site specific python module paths (lib/python, local/lib/python). These paths
are now set using standard mechanisms of python (lib/python2.7/sitecustomize.py).
