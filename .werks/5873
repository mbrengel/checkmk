The management board of hosts can now be configured to be monitored via IPMI
as alternative to the previous SNMP monitoring.

To configure the IPMI management board for a host, you need to edit the
host configuration. Set the addresss of the management board, choose IPMI
as management board protocol and specify the IPMI credentials.
After this, you should be able to find new services named "Management interface: ..."
using the service discovery.

To make your configuration a bit less explicit, you can specify the IPMI protocol
and credentials on folders instead of specifying it explicit for each host.
Another option is to use the ruleset "Management board config" to configure the
credentials. But you will have to set at least the protocol on host/folders and
the management board address for each host.
