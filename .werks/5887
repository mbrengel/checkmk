Class: fix

When a check declares a Check_MK internal configuration variable in it's global
namespace, for example "service_descriptions", it was overrding Check_MK internal
configuration variables with this statement in previous Check_MK versions.

Check_MK now prevents the checks from overriding already known configuration
variables.
