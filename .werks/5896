Title: Improved output of Check_MK services
Level: 1
Component: core
Compatible: compat
Edition: cre
Version: 1.5.0b1

Class: fix

<ul>
<li>The result of the different data sources was not visible to the user
in the Check_MK service.</li>
<li>The Check_MK service is now showing individual status information
about each data source (e.g. the agent version).</li>
<li>The Check_MK HW/SW Inventory and Check_MK Discovery services are
only showing data source related details in case a problem happened
for a data source.</li>
<li>The states of Check_MK, Check_MK Discovery and Check_MK HW/SW Inventory
are now working in the same way (and all respect the "Check_MK service" ruleset)
settings. This makes e.g. the Check_MK Discovery service result in CRIT states
e.g. in case of agent communication errors when there is no cache file present
where it previously only reported a WARN state.</li>
</ul>
