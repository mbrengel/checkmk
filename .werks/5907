The previous Check_MK packages were not explicitly declaring the dependency
to the php-cli package which is needed to make Dokuwiki, NagVis and PNP4Nagios
work.

The dependency was only declared for php which normally implies php-cli.
Unfortunately there are third party packages that don't have this implicit
dependency.

To make Check_MK work out of the box with those PHP installations, we now added
php-cli and php-xml as explicit dependency.
