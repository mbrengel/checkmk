Werk #5704 introduced querying the supported IP families (IPv4/IPv6)
upon agent start. This query makes use of the WinAPI function
WSCEnumProtocols. This function turned out to contain a severe bug:
if the protocol buffer passed as in/out parameter is not big enough
to accommodate all available transport protocols, the function corrupts
the heap by writing to memory past the buffer. This violates the
MSDN documentation of WSCEnumProtocols, also the example code attached
to the documentation is broken.

So far, the bug has only been reported on older 32 bit systems
(Windows Server 2008). However, the real extent of the problem is not
known as there are no bug reports about WSCEnumProtocols publicly
available to determine, if the function is broken in all Windows
versions or just in some. A key factor is the number of
configured/supported transport protocols: if the number grows large
enough, WSCEnumProtocols causes the described buffer overflow.

Now the use of WSCEnumProtocols has been changed so that - on the
contrary to the documentation in MSDN - the function is always called
twice to prevent the buffer overflow by allocating the necessary buffer
only after first querying the necessary buffer size.
