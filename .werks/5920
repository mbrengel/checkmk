Until now, Windows agent was using a non-standard way of defining recursive
wildcards. From now on, the supported wildcard patterns '*', '?' and '**' work
in a standardized way. Recursive patterns can be defined with '**', matching
all descendants of the path so far. Previous patterns with single '*'s on
several directory levels will from now on work as non-recursive patterns
conforming to the standard.
