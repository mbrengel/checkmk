When using "omd start/restart" or the init script etc/init.d/nagios to
start or restart nagios, it was possible that the core started with an
outdated configuration.

During start/restart the nagios init script is working in two steps: 1. config
validation and 2. start/restart of the nagios process. During both steps the
whole object configuration (etc/nagios/conf.d) needs to be processed. To
optimize this the first step is perfoming some precompiling of the read config
files. The result is saved in the file var/nagios/objects.precache and read
by the core during startup instead of the single object config files.

The init script had an option set (CORE_NOVERIFY=yes) in all cases that
prevented the config verification even when executed manually. Without the
config verification the object precache was not updated before the restart,
making the core load an outdated file. The variable CORE_NOVERIFY=yes should
only be set when the config verification has already been done. For example cmk
-R/-O is doing exactly this.

A workaround is to trigger the restarts using "cmk -R".
