It is now possible to configure hosts in Check_MK that have no IP address configured.
This is useful e.g. in case a host is only monitored using piggyback data from another
host.

In previous versions of Check_MK a fake IP address had to be configured for each host
to prevent warning messages during config generation and during monitoring.

To configure a host without IP, simply set the "IP address family" attribute of a host
to "No IP".

The host check of these hosts will always report "UP" by default. To override this, you
can use the rule set "Host check command".
