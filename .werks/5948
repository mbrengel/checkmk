Title: docker_container_mem: Docker container specific memory checking

Class: feature

Instead of using the default linux memory check (mem), Check_MK is now
using the container specific memory check.

The main reason is that the memory information in the container is not
available through <tt>/proc/meminfo</tt> as usual. The memory data is available
through the kernels cgroup interface which is available in the containers
context below <tt>/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.stat</tt>

The features of both checks are exactly the same.
