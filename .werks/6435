When OMD stop is being performed not all processes of the site user were
stopped. The call only tried to stop the processes controlled by the init
scripts.

After a "omd stop" call for all processes of a site stopped the processes
controlled by the init scripts, OMD is now searching for remaining
(uncontrolled) site processes, e.g. still running background jobs or other
processes and sends a SIGTERM to each of them.

It waits up to 5 seconds for them to stop. In case the processes did not
finish in time, it terminates the OMD call with an exit code of 1.
