Title: wmi.include: Check_MK Discovery does not report 'vanished services' for WMI services if WMI timeout

If a timeout occurs in a Windows agent section while executing WMI queries the
related services were handled as vanished services by the Check_MK Discovery
service. This may be misleading because this timeout is short-lived.

The WMI query timeouts are a known problem in Windows and can not be solved by
the Check_MK agent. Please see
https://github.com/martinlindhe/wmi_exporter/issues/89 for further information.

Now the Check_MK Discovery does not take WMI timeouts into account. Thus the
Check_MK Discovery does not report "vanished services" any more.  The Check_MK
service handles services with WMI timeouts as "stale" further on.
