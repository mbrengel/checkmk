Title: Being more robust against duplicat engineIDs when monitoring SNMPv3 devices
Level: 1
Component: inline-snmp
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1433506248
Class: fix

The engineID is defined to be a globally unique identifier of a SNMPv3 device, but it happens
that users configure the same engineID multiple times for different devices, which made
Check_MK only talk to one of them and reporting "No Response from host (Timeout 0/-24)" for
the other devices. This has been changed now that Check_MK disregards the misconfiguration
and works as usual.
