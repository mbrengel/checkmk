Title: Improved performance of Check_MK NagVis Maps Snapin
Level: 2
Component: nagvis
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1436188027

The NagVis Maps snapin of the Check_MK sidebar was not performing very well
when a lot of users were accessing the Check_MK GUI at the same time. NagVis
introduced a new caching for the snapin contents which should decrease the
loading time of the snapin dramatically.
