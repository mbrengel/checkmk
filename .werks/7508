When a SNMP device which has a bug in it's SNMP implementation is responding
with a value which can not be parsed, e.g. a number which is increasing the
maximum value of a 32bit integer, the packet was dropped. The SNMP engine
was retrying to fetch the data and finally timing out. These timeouts
has been fixed now.
