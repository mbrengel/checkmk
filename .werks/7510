Title: msi generation: improved error handling, removed version information from product name
Level: 1
Component: packages
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1433838935

The agent version is no longer displayed in the product name.
This is because some software management tools have troubles to detect the same
product family if the name differs.

Additionally the error handling during the msi generation (done by the agent bakery)
has been improved.
