Title: Add missing empty directories after copying sites with omd cp -N
Level: 1
Component: omd
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i2

Class: fix

If you copied a site using the option <tt>-N</tt> on <tt>omd cp</tt> then
several directories would be missing - namely those that contain the omitted
data (log files, performance data etc.). This has been fixed and the empty
directories are correctly being created in the copy now.
