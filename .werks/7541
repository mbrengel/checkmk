Title: rrdcached: added commands to suspend writing to rrd files
Level: 1
Component: packages
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1462804440
Class: feature

using these commands, one can backup rrd files in a consistent state.
There are four new commands in total, 2 for suspend, 2 for resume,
one each applying to individual files (SUSPEND/RESUME) and one each
for all files at once (SUSPENDALL/RESUMEALL).
Please note that these mechanisms are independent from each other so
you can't use RESUMEALL to release files suspended with SUSPEND
