Title: Silently ignoring deprecated "gadget_type" option now
Level: 1
Component: nagvis
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1456864328
Class: fix

Changed handling of deprecated map object attributes: They are silently
ignored by NagVis now. We inform users about deprecated (useless)
attributes in the ChangeLog and will mark old options in the documentation,
but the map loading will not be affected by the deprecated options anymore
