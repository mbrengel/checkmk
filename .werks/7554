When configuring a system apache for service the webpages via HTTPS and not
via HTTP, the default Check_MK web cron job which is executed once each minute
was not executed correctly because it used http://localhost/[siteid] to call 
the cron job. This URL is only working when the system apache is listening
on port 80 (HTTP) at least on localhost. 

We have now changed the default cron job to directly use the site apache instead
of the system apache for calling the cron job. This is working even when the
system apache is configured to only listen via HTTPS.
