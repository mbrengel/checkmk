Title: Updated NSCA to be compatible with clients of newer distros
Level: 1
Component: packages
Class: fix
Compatible: incomp
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1459428947

Some distros ship newer version of send_nsca which are not compatible
anymore with the old NSCA 2.7 server shipped with Check_MK. So we had
to update NSCA to 2.9.1.

The version is incompatible in one detail: If you are submitting
multiple check results at once you can not use new lines (\n) anymore.
You will have to change it to use the ETB character. This was a subtile
and not well documented change in NSCA. The help text of send_nsca
contains the following text:

===
When submitting multiple simultaneous results, separate each set with the ETB
character (^W or 0x17)
===
