During monitoring there are several dedicated files created for each host.
There are, for example, the discovered services, performance data and
different temporary files created. During deletion of a host, these files
are normally deleted. But there are cases, where the files are left on
the disk until manual deletion, for example if you move a host from one
site to another or deleting a host manually from the configuration.

The performance data (RRDs) and HW/SW inventory archive are never deleted
during host deletion.

We have now added the functionality to cleanup the host related files to
the diskspace cleanup mechanism. This mechanism is enabled by default and
cleans up all files of not existing hosts that are older than 1 month by
default. If you want to disable this automatic deletion or customize the
time horizon, you can configure it in the global settings of WATO using the
"Automatic disk space cleanup" option.
