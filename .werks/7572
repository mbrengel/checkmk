The rrdcached used a naive algorithm for handling its write buffer, leading
to quadratic time complexity: In an example at hand, more than 130GB of data
was needlessly shuffled around when trying to fetch a small amount of data
points. This algorithm has been replaced by one with amortized linear
complexity, vastly improving performance for various rrdcached operations.

Fixed a few arbitrary length restrictions on the way.
