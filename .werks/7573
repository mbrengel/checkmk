Title: Fixed a threading bug in the RRDTool library and rrdcached
Level: 2
Component: packages

Class: fix

Older GLib versions (< 2.32, e.g. the ones shipped with CentOS 5 and 6, SLES11,
Debian 6) need an explicit initialization to make things thread-safe. RRDTools
didn't do that, so the Check_MK Micro Core and rrdcached crashed randomly on
those systems. Now we make sure that GLib is properly initialized before
calling into it.
