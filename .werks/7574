Title: Fixed segfaults when using inline SNMP
Level: 2
Component: inline-snmp
Class: fix
Compatible: compat

The Python binding for the netsnmp library did not handle signals correctly,
which could lead to occasional segfaults.  This was visible in Check_MK when
inline SNMP was activated, leading to repeated segfaults in the check
helpers.
