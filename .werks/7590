Title: Check_MK is now shipping with own Python 2.7.12 interpreter
Level: 2
Component: packages
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1465131282
Class: feature

This step has been made to make Python based components, like Check_MK,
be able to rely on one single Python version independent of the
distibution OMD is being installed on.

Python scripts should use "#!/usr/bin/env python" as shebang to be
working within OMD without change. Something like "#!/usr/bin/python"
would not use the interpreter shipped with OMD.
