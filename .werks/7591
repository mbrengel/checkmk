Title: Debian: Harmonized default version handling with RPM based distros
Level: 2
Component: deb
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i1
Date: 1465131369
Class: fix

Previous OMD installations were leaving previously set default version
untouched during installation of a new OMD package on Debian based
distributions. This was handled differently on Debian and RPM based
distributions and lead to confusions when using both platforms.
We decided to unify the behaviour on all distributins and make OMD
automatically set the default version to the new one during
installation of a new package.
