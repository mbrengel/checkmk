Title: omd restore: Fixed issue when backing up / restoring as sites named "nagios"
Level: 1
Component: omd
Class: fix

When a site was named exactly like a symlink target, the site restore failed. For
example there is a symlink "var/icinga" pointing to "nagios" on the same directory
level. So in case there was a site named "nagios" backed up and restored, the restore
failed.

This may also occur for other, maybe custom symlinks, linking to files in the same
directory.
