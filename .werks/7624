Class: fix

The files var/log/nagios.log var/nagios/nagios.log var/log/livestatus.log
and var/nagios/livestatus.log were originally created by the skel/ mechanism,
but were changed by either nagios itself during runtime and also when changing
the monitoring core. The files have now been removed from skel/ hierarchy and
are managed by the CORE hook.
