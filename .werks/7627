Title: Apache: Reduced default maximum apache processes to 64

Class: fix

The maximum number of concurrent apache processes has been lowered from
128 to 64. The main reason for this is to prevent out of memory situations
on a lot of systems in case of high webserver loads.

Most Check_MK systems don't have enough memory in spare to handle 128 apache
processes and for the most systems the default of 64 should still be way
enough.

In case you need more than the new default, you can simply change
etc/apache/apache.conf to increase the number of slots again.
