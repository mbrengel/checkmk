Title: Fixed OpenSSL version warning when used on older distros (e.g. SLES11)
Level: 1
Component: packages
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1486125844
Class: fix

The warning message could occur e.g. when using the active check "check_bi_aggr"
or other components on older distros that ship with an old OpenSSL version that
is not supported anymore by the OpenSSL project.

The message is:

"You are linking against OpenSSL 0.9.8, which is no longer

RuntimeError: You are linking against OpenSSL 0.9.8, which is no longer
support by the OpenSSL project. You need to upgrade to a newer version
of OpenSSL."

Basically this is only a warning message, but prevents some components form working
properly because scripts are producing unexpected output.
