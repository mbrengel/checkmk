When having specific "diskspace cleanup" settings set via WATO or configured directly in etc/diskspace.conf,
this may result in an exception "TypeError ('int' object is not iterable)" when saving unrelated global settings.

As workaround this could be fixed by cleaning up the etc/diskspace.conf file.
