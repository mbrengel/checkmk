When a new site is created an entry for the tmpfs of the site is
appended to the /etc/fstab. In case the last entry of the file did
not end with a newline character the appending of this tmpfs entry
resulted in a broken line.

We now check the previous entry ends with a newline char and ensure
it is separated with a newline char correctly.
