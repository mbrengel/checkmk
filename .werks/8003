Title: New livestatus column services_with_fullstate for hosts table
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: livestatus
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1394450890
Class: feature

The Livestatus implementation in the Micro Core got a new column with the
detailed state of a service in the table hosts. This is the same feature
as in the upstream version. The new column is being used by Check_MK BI in
order to optionally base a BI aggregate on soft rather than hard states and
to reflect the downtime and acknowledgment state in BI.
