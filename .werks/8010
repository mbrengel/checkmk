Class: feature

The Micro Core has now a new option (to be configured in the global
settings via WATO) for sending the performance data (in addition) to an
already existing Graphite installation. Simple enter hostname/IP-addresse
and port number of your Graphite carbon line receiver (usually port 2003)
and activate your changes. Optionally you can specify a prefix to be added
to the variable names in graphite. That way you can put all of your graphs
into a subfolder in Graphite.
