This only applies with the setting group_authorization = AUTH_STRICT.

When an auth user was given the livestatus tables hostgroups and servicegroups did not
check if the auth user had permissions to all objects of the group.
As a result the user was able to view host- and servicegroups, even if he was not a contact
for every object in it. However, the "forbidden" object itself was not returned, just a subset
of the group. This was incorrect. The user needs to be contact of every element in this group.
Otherwise he should not see the group at all..
