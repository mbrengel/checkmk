This makes the Micro Core compatible to the different variants that
Nagios allows for performance data variables. Now it is allowed to
specify <tt>"foo bar test"=18</tt> or <tt>'foo bar test'=18</tt>
as performance data. This means that the name of the variable 
may be quoted with either single or double quotes.
