The host check interval for hosts when using the Micro Core has been 6 seconds.
This is a good setting when using Smart-PING (which is the default). When you
switch to an alternative command like <tt>check_tcp</tt>, then 6 seconds is
too fast in most situations. So we changed the default interval for all
non-Smart-PING hosts to 60 seconds.
