Title: Allow to limit number of hosts and service via config

Class: feature

There are now two new global settings for <tt>main.mk</tt> that allow limiting
the number of monitored hosts and/or services. This option only works when
using the Check_MK Micro Core. Example:

F+:main.mk
cmc_host_limit = 100
cmc_service_limit = 3000
F-:

If you now try to activate a configuration with more than 100 hosts or more
then 3000 services you will run into an error and the old configuration is
being kept. It is also possible to just set a limit on hosts <i>or</i>
services. Setting the according variable to <tt>None</tt> deactivates the
limit. This is the default.

This setting can <b>not</b> be changed via WATO. It can be useful in situations
where you give access to a user or customer via WATO but want to restrict
the amount of objects that he/she can monitor.
