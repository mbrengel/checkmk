Title: Inline-SNMP bulk walk now handles timeout errors like the classic SNMP code
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: inline-snmp
Version: 1.2.5i1
Date: 1395738505
Class: fix

Previous versions produced error messages like "Empty response to SNMP query for ..."
in case of a timeout when doing a bulk walk with inline SNMP. This was a different
handling to non bulk walk queries and SNMPv1, which resulted in strange error
behavious. This has now been consolidated and fixed. These timeouts are now mostly
suppressed and are only visible when using the <tt>-v</tt> flag with <tt>check_mk</tt>.
