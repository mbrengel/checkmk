Title: Adapted bulkwalk behaviour of snmp command to fix issue with missing OID

Class: fix

The previous implementation of the bulkwalk in our inline SNMP code was not
working as e.g. the snmpbulkwalk command of net-snmp. The bulkwalk command
asks for an OID via bulkwalk, processes the response and when none of the
responded OIDs matches this OID, the command performs an explicit SNMP GET
on the requested OID to get that single value. This has now been added.
