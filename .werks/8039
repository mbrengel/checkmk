When a SNMP bulk walk on an OID does not return the requested OID, but was successful
in general, an additional SNMP-GET is executed to try to get that explicit requested
OID. This is implemented like it is in standard <tt>snmpbulkwalk</tt> command.

There was an error handling non existant OIDs during the mentioned SNMP-GET. This
should be fixed now.
