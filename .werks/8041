Title: Added option to profile the efficiency of inline SNMP
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: inline-snmp
Version: 1.2.5i4

Class: fix

With this mechanism, the usage of the fetched SNMP vars can now be recorded
and later analyzed. Hopefully we can increase the efficiency of inline SNMP
a bit more.

This feature can be enabled using the WATO option <tt>Record statistics of Inline SNMP</tt>.
But only enable this for a short period, because this might affect the performance
of your monitoring.
