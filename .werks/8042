Title: Fixed service descriptions of hr_fs when using Inline-SNMP with windows hosts
Level: 1

Class: fix

hr_fs found different services when on windows hosts when inline SNMP is either
enabled or disabled. For example C:\\ when disabled and C:\ when enabled. This
has been cleaned up. The service descriptions with inline-SNMP are now equal to
the classic ones.

This might also affect other services and also values of checks when Inline SNMP
is enabled, because a genric part of the SNMP value parsing code has been modified.
