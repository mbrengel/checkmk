Title: Add LASTHOSTPROBLEMID and LASTSERVICEPROBLEMID to notifications
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.5i3
Date: 1399022991
Class: fix

These two variables are now being added to the notification context.
Since the CMC does not set 0 for recoveries in the HOSTPROBLEMID
field, the LAST... fields have the same value.
