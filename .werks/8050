When a host or services goes from OK into a hard non-OK state, then
a new problem ID is generated. When the state now changes between several
different non-OK states and goes finally back to OK, then the same
problem ID is being reused in all notifications. That way a matching of
notifications in an external system is possible. Previously each state
change created a new problem ID.
