Title: Smart PING now uses same layout as vanilla PING
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.5i3

Class: feature

The Smart PING of the Micro Core now per defaults creates exactly the same type of
packets that a plain command line <tt>ping</tt> does. This has the disadvantage of
creating larger packets then neccessary - but has the advantage of being compatible
with more firewalls. Some of those tend to regard ICMP ECHO REQUEST packets without
payload as some bogus attack and drop them.

You can reenable PING packets without payout via a new global option for
<tt>main.mk</tt>:

F+:main.mk
cmc_smartping_omit_payload = True
F-:

This is also available via WATO in the global settings of the Micro Core.
