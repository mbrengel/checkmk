Up to now the CMC adopted the behaviour of Nagios when it came to the
authorization of seeing host and service groups. Nagios lets a user see a
host group only if he is contact for <b>every</b> host in that group. That
leads to anomalies, however. Because in the details of a host you can see
the group nevertheless and some of the views kind of display a host group,
just by printing out the host plus the group it is contained in.

Both in normal Livestatus and with the CMC you can change the behaviour.
In CMC this is done with <i>Authorization settings</i> in the global
settings.

<b>Note:</b> the new default setting is now <i>loose</i>. If you want
back the previous behaviour, please change it back in the global
settings.
