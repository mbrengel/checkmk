In situations where the operating system in in high disk I/O and
many processes run into disk wait, the micro core seemed sometimes
to register PING timeouts. That was simply due to the fact that
the core itself was delayed and thought the PING packages didn't
arrive in time.

This has now been fixed, by assuming that when checking the
PING timeout taking into account the time since the last check:
CMC assumes now that all PING must have arrived directly at
the beginning of the current interval, not at the end.
