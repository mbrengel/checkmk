Title: Implemented limiting of fetched OIDs for if/if64 checks
Level: 1

Class: feature

It is now possible to configure a rule in WATO which limits the number of
OIDs fetched by a check, for example the if/if64 check, which might then
only fetch the information for some interfaces instead of all interfaces.

This is a performance optimisation feature which is only useful for special
use cases. The OID ranges to fetch need to be specified manually and can
only be configured for a small subset of checks where it makes sense to
configure it. It applies only when using bulk walks with Inline-SNMP.

In case of the interface checks this rule might be useful when you have
e.g. a network switch with several hundrets of interfaces and only want
to monitor a small amount of the network interfaces, for example the
first 10 interfaces.
