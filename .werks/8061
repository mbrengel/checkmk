Class: fix

When the Inline-SNMP code was currently executing Net-SNMP library
code while a check timeout (SIGALRM) occured, this resulted in
a segmentation fault which leads to an unexpected situation. This
resulted in totally terminated checks or broken WATO service
discovery pages. This issue has been fixed now.
