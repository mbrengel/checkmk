Title: Remove bogus error messages in cmc.log when core restarts
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: fix

When you restart the core and there are currently running Check_MK checks
that have to be aborted then the CMC logfile prints a line:

F+:cmc.log
2014-12-01 10:57:26 [5] Check helper [24933] exited with status 1
F-:

This line has been reclassified from error (<tt>[3]</tt>) to notice
(<tt>[5]</tt>). This will avoid bogus error message in the logfile monitoring
of the Check_MK appliances.
