Title: Savely direct any verbose or diagnostic output from check_mk or checks to cmc.log
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: cmc

Class: feature

If any check outputs something to stdout or stderr (which it should not do in
production mode) or if a function in the check_mk code (such as inline SNMP)
outputs data to stdout or stderr, then this will now savely be logged to the
CMC log with the classification "warning". This will allow easier debugging
and error handling. Also the logfile <tt>cmc-helper.log</tt> will no longer
be created. Messages go into <tt>cmc.log</tt> instead.
