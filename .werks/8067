Title: Delay service notification when host comes up

When a host is DOWN and then a service of that host goes CRIT, the
corresponding notification is put on hold. As soon as the host goes up again
the notification would immediately be sent out. Now we rather wait for the
next check of the service, in order to give it a chance to become OK again,
after the host is reachable again.
