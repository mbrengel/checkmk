Title: Fix notification type for the end of downtimes
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.5i6

Class: fix

When a downtime ends the CMC used to set the NOTIFICATION_TYPE to
<tt>DOWNTIMESTOPPED</tt>, while Nagios uses <tt>DOWNTIMEEND</tt>. This
leads to an invalid notification classification in the rule based
notification, so that instead of the type <i>Downtime Start or End</i>
a normal altert type was being assumed. That has been fixed now.
