Class: fix

When you use period notifications and have a hard state change e.g. from WARN to CRIT
then the notification for this state change would be delayed until the next periodic
notification.

This has been fixed. Any non-OK state change will now immediately be notified.
Furthermore any first notification delay will <b>not</b> be applied in that case.
