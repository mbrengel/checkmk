Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: config
Version: 1.2.5i6
Date: 1413299523
Class: feature

This new commanline option for the <tt>cmk</tt> tool will change exising
RRD databases to match the configuration that is done via the WATO rulesets
<i>Configuration of RRD databases of hosts</i> and <i>Configuration of RRD
databases of services</i>. Otherwise changes in these rules applied only on
new RRDs.

You can restrict the conversion to one or several hosts:

C+:
OM:cmk -v --convert-rrds myhost1 myhost2
myhost1:
  HOST
    - rta....uptodate
    - pl....uptodate
    - rtmax....uptodate
    - rtmin....uptodate
  Postfix Queue
    - length....uptodate
    - size....uptodate
  CPU utilization
    - user....converted, 376 KB -> 40 KB
    - system....converted, 376 KB -> 40 KB
    - wait....converted, 376 KB -> 40 KB
[...]
C-:

If you do not specify any hostname, then <b>all</b> RRDs will
be converted.

<b>Note:</b> this new option uses a completely new feature of the RRDTool,
which has been sponsored by Mathias Kettner: RRDTool can now change the
internal structure of RRDs on-the-fly. That way it is now for example possible
to change the range of time or precision that data is being kept.

<b>Note 2:</b> this feature uses an <b>experimental</b> version of
RRDTool. Please make a backup of your RRDs before trying this out.
