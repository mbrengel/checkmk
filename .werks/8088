Title: Fix problem with Smart PING packets not being sent (Out of Buffer Space)

This problem has been fixed by splitting up the <tt>icmphelper</tt> into
a <tt>icmpsender</tt> and a <tt>icmpreceiver</tt>. Both processes now do
not need to do any <tt>select()</tt>. The pcap-library can thus be used
in a standard way. Previously it could happen that it did not see all
packets.
