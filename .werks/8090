Title: Report scheduler - automatically email reports on a regular base
Level: 3
Edition: cee
Component: reporting
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415699307
Class: feature

The new reporting scheduler allows users to have reports emailed at
regular intervals. The scheduler is available for admins and normal
users. Normal users can only mail reports to themselves.

Currently the schedule can be daily, weekly or monthly, where you
can configure the time of day and the relative day in the week
or month.

The scheduler allows to specify contexts for reports that need
a context. For example you can use the shipped example report
<i>Report of host</i> and specify the host to report about
directly in the scheduler.
