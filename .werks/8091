Title: Make baked agents and configuration files unreadable for the world
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1415783069
Class: fix

This is just for security. Agents and configuration files <b>might</b> contain
passwords. So read access to the agents on the monitoring server is now only
allowed for the OMD site user. Read access to any configuration file on the
agent itself in <tt>/etc/check_mk</tt> (Linux) is denied for the others.
