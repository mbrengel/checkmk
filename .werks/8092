The agent bakery used to always create a so called <i>Generic agent</i>. That was
an agent with a default configuration.

Now the bakery per default creates two - possible identical - agents: The <i>Vanilla</i>-agent is
what had been the generic agent. It is an agent without any plugins and with the default
configuration. The <i>Generic</i> agent is an agent with all rulesets being applied that do
not have any positive restrictions. It is the agent for a generic host, i.e. a host that
has no tags and no name. All rules that do not require certain tags to be <i>set</i> or
do require the host to have a certain name are being used. This allows you to create a proper
agent without creating any host at the first place.
