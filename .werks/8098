Class: fix

If you connected the Check_MK Micro Core to Carbon (Graphite) and the
carbon server was down then the core would hang after a while in a
very nasty long TCP timeout. This is been fixed. If carbon is too slow
to handle all the data or if the server is hanging then Check_MK uses
the available TCP buffer space for queing graph updates and skips then
any further updates, while logging a message into <tt>cmc.log</tt>:
