When you have disabled the notifications of a service (or host) via a
command and later disabled the notifications of the same service via a rule,
then in effect the notification became enabled again! This was due to the
internally stored information about which setting has been modified. This
has now been fixed. The core now correctly keeps track of which enabling
(notifications, active and passive checks) has been modified and which is
the new manual setting. The manual setting will override any configuration
setting until it is cleared.

Clearing manual settings can be done with the command <i>Clear modified
attributes</i> in Multisite (which internall calls <tt>CHANGE_HOST_MODATTR</tt>
or <tt>CHANGE_SVC_MODATTR</tt>.

<b>Note</b>: The Nagios core behaves different here. Clearing the modified
attributes just removes the information that they have been modified -
not their actual setting! There is no way to generally remove manual settings
here other then manually set all back to their configuration settings and
<b>afterwards</b> again issue <i>Clear modified attributes</i>. The CMC
decided to not mimick this strange behaviour.
