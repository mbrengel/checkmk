Title: Take check period into account when computing the staleness
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.6b1
Date: 1417518188
Class: feature

When it comes to check staleness then the CMC now takes the check period of
a host/service into account. When the object is out of its check period then
we take the beginning of that inactive phase as a reference - not the current
time. The effect is that the staleness value is frozen at the end of the check
period. That way checks that are out of their period are not any longer shown
as stale - unless they already have been stale when the inactive phase started.

Note: This only works when using CMC. The Nagios core has no information about
previous timeperiod transistions so this cannot be implemented there.
