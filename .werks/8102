Title: The Micro Core now safely detects corrupted state files
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc

Class: fix

If due to a disk-full situation or other reasons the file
<tt>var/check_mk/core/state</tt> was empty, corrupted or incomplete the CMC
would crash with a segmentation fault in many cases. This has been fixed by
savely checking the already existing end-of-file magic marker <i>before</i>
processing the file.
