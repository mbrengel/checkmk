Title: Slight change in SMART Ping packages, should increase compatibility with routers
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.6b1

Class: fix

The SMART ping ICMP echo request packages now use a new unique ICMP Identifier
for each packet and always use sequence ID 0. The previous version used
a fixed identifier and a ever changing sequence ID. We hope that the new
approach is more suitable for firewalls.
