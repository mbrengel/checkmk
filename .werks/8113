Class: fix

Timeouts of walks/bulkwalks of Inline-SNMP are now handled equal
to classic SNMP implementation. When a timeout occurs for the
configured X SNMP retries after Y SNMP timeouts (configured via
SNMP Timing Options), the whole "Check_MK" service is terminated
assuming that the host is not available.
