The "Check_MK Discovery" check was executed as active check, initializing the whole
python interpreter, check_mk and the whole check_mk configuration for each check,
just to perform an inventory check for a single host.

Now the "Check_MK Discovery" service also uses the permanently running Check_MK
Helper processes just like the regular Check_MK service which results in a big
performanc boosts for environments with a large number of hosts using the
"Check_MK Discovery" service.
