We already changed the way smartping was operating some time ago, this solved the
"no buffer space available" problem for many systems and increased the possible
number of hosts to be pinged dramatically.

This did not fix the problem for all systems. Some systems with maybe slower network
cards or drivers still had the problem that the message "no buffer space available"
appeared from time to time in the cmc.log. This occured when the cmc was asking for
ping requests faster than the kernel / NIC could process them. The send queue of the
single raw socket was filling up to the maximum and then resulting in this error message.

The icmpsender now opens 8 sockets instead of 1 for sending the ICMP requests.
Additionally the socktes now get a larger send buffer to make it less likely to fill up.
