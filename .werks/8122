Title: Disabling host checks is now working correctly

In previous versions, when the user disabled the host checks,
it only stopped sending out ICMP requests. Processing incoming
ICMP packets and marking host as down in case of too long time
without answer still resulted in hosts getting marked as critical.
This has been fixed now. The host state won't change anymore when
disabled.
