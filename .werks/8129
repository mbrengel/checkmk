Class: feature

When an acknowledgement is being created or removed or an acknowledgement
ends because of a state change or expires then now an entry in made in
the monitoring log. Example:

F+:var/check_mk/core/history
[1420818703] HOST ACKNOWLEDGE ALERT: xyserver12;STARTED;omdadmin;Some comment...
F-:

These entries are visiable via Multisite and via Livestatus. This only works
with the CMC.
