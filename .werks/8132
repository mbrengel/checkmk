Title: New tuning of SMART ping - throttling of PING rate
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc

Class: feature

The Smart PING engine in the Check_MK Micro Core has now an option
of throttling the maximum rate of PINGs. This helps in situtations
where a firewall is not able to process e.g. 1000 ICMP echo requests
in one millisecond. Throttling is disabled per default.

Note: The setting for omitting the ICMP payload has moved to the
new setting. If you have used this setting you need to enable it
again.
