The PING services, which is being created for hosts which are not monitored
via SNMP or agent, sometimes reported packet loss of x% while the host check
of the microcore reported that the host is reachable without problems.

This issue was caused by the way the Micro Core icmpsender generated the ICMP
packages. These packages seemed to confuse the check_icmp plugin which is
executed by the PING service.
