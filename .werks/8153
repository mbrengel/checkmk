If you configured a notification delay of more than 2147 seconds (approx 35
minutes, precisely 2^31 micro seconds) then due to an internal range overflow
the actual delay would be somewhere between -2147 and +2147 seconds. So in
some cases the delay was just too short, in other it was negative and that
way totally ineffective. This has been fixed.
