The <i>Pages</i> feature of PNP4Nagios ignores hosts where the performance
data is not updated anymore. It does this by looking at the modification time
of the directory where the host's RRDs are being stored. Since the Micro
Core simply opened the existing XML files for writing when updating them,
this modification time never changed and PNP thought that all hosts were
dead. This has been fixed by now by always creating a <tt>.xml.new</tt>
file frist and then renaming this to <tt>.xml</tt>. This also avoids very
short times where the file is empty.
