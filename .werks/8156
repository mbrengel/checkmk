The Check_MK Micro Core now forces a rotation of the history logfile if its
size exceeds a configure limit. This avoids too large logfiles in situations
with a high logging volume. Large logfile make problems in certain Livestatus
queries. The default is now to force a rotation at a size of 20 MB. You can
configure this limit within the bounds of 10 KB and 1 GB.
