Title: New table layout for reporting
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: reporting
Version: 1.2.7i1
Date: 1424011366
Class: feature

Tables in the reporting are new per default painted in alternative
background shadings for odd and even rows. This is similar to the styling
on the screen. This is just a new default. You can change this back to the
previous behaviour in the global settings, if you like.
