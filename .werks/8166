Title: Limit SNMP OID Ranges now supporting ranges from the end of the table

When performing walks on an OID during checking, Check_MK fetches all sub OIDs regardless
whether these values are needed or not. For example, if you monitor a single
network interface of a switch with hundrets of ports, the check will fetch the
information for all the interfaces, while only one is used.

The OID range limiting can be used to reduce the amount of fetched OIDs, but please note,
this is only useful for special cases like the example above and only used when you
perform bulkwalks.

Previous versions did only support ranges starting from the start of an SNMP table. With
this change it is also possible to specify OID ranges of N entries from the end of the
SNMP table.

When such an "end limit" is configured, the first column of a table is fetched in total,
while only keeping the requested OIDs but also saving the needed indexes of this table.
For all additional columns of this table only the requested OIDs are fetched.
