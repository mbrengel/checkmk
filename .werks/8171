Previously the agent bakery was baking all needed agents during each reload/restart etc.
by default. This has been disabled now. You might re-enable it by setting the global
configuration option <i>Automatically create monitoring agents</i> again if you really
need it.

For all other users: When you open up the WATO Monitoring Agents page, there is a new
button <i>Bake Agents</i> now, which you can click to let the bakery update all needed
agents. Each WATO change or Check_MK update makes the button be highlighted to let you
know there might be changes affecting the baked agents. Once clicked on the button,
all needed agents are baked and the highlighting is removed.
