Title: Processing SNMP values unmodified to checks (might break some SNMP checks)
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: inline-snmp
Version: 1.2.7i1

Class: fix

Previous versions of the Inline-SNMP code were replacing and
stripping different characters from the values reported by
SNMP. This has been done to be compatible to the classic SNMP
behaviour and to fix different cases of strange characters in
the SNMP data.
We decided to clean this totally up that the single checks get
the real unmodified SNMP values which then need to be handled
by the SNMP checks individually.
