Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1440161390
Class: feature

You can now configure via a WATO rule that additional files can be deployed
with the windows agent.  All you have to do is to put these files/folders in
the directory <i>~/local/share/check_mk/agents/custom</i> and configure the
WATO rule accordingly. For further details have a look at the description
of the rule "Deploy custom files with agent".  These custom files will
be included in the MSI package and are automatically installed during the
Check_MK installation / update.
