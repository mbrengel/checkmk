When you have defined custom host macros like <tt>_FOO</tt> via
<tt>extra_host_conf</tt> in <tt>main.mk</tt> or other configuration
files, these macros are now known and will be replaced on the command line
of active check plugins. The macro in the example will be specified
with <tt>$HOST_FOO</tt>.
