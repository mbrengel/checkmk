The new graphing system has a new thing called <i>Graph Collections</i>. Such a collection
contains a list of specific host and service graphs. Each user can create an arbitrary
number of own collections. Collections can by published to be visible to other users
- just like views. And they become visible in the <i>Views</i> sidebar snapin within
the topic <i>Metrics</i>.

Adding a graph to a collection is done by simply clicking on a new icon right
within the graph. It opens a popup menu where you can select one of your
collections to add to.
