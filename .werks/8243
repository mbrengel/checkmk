Title: Handle and display information about cached agent data in GUI
Level: 2

Check_MK now keeps track of the original age of information sent by the
monitoring agents. This is useful if certain agent sections are not generated
anew each time the agent is called but that are cached either locally on the
agent or on the Check_MK server (using the <tt>persist</tt> section option).

The sections in question need to declare the age
and lifetime of the cached data in the section header,
e.g. <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;foobar:cached(1431431239:86400)&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>.
Check_MK parses this information and hands it over to the Check_MK Micro Core.
The core uses that for a precise computation of the staleness and also makes
it available for the Multisite GUI.

The GUI in turn uses the point of time where the cached information has been
created as the time of the <i>last check</i> instead of the last execution of
Check_MK. In the details of a service you can see both the age and lifetime
of the cached data.

When using Nagios or another core the new information from the agents
is simply being ignored an nothing changes.
