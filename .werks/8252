After all bulkwalks which return an empty set of data without having an error situation,
an SNMP GET is performed to verify that there really is no data at the requested OID.

The inline SNMP code was treating some error situations like NOSUCHOBJECT or NOSUCHINSTANCE
which occur when a device does not know the requested OID wrong. It returned an empty string
instead of no data which might confuse our SNMP engine or checks.
