Title: Fixed using cached agent data during regular checks

During runtime of the CMC it might happen that the data gathered
by the Check_MK Helpers is not up-to-date since they were using
cached data during checks. This only happened when having the
"Check_MK Discovery" service activated which regularly checks for
new services to be monitored.

Once the "Check_MK Discovery" services was executed for one host
in a helper process, this problem occured for all further checks
being performed by this helper.
