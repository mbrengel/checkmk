The rule "Limit SNMP OID Ranges for Bulkwalks" is available in Check_MK since some time,
but it was only possible to define OID ranges from the start and end of the SNMP tables.
Now it is possible to define ranges starting at a specified offset.

This rule can be used to not fetch whole SNMP tables which might be useful to save prevent
Check_MK from fetching large SNMP tables. This is used to reduce overhead and improve the
performance of SNMP communication. Normally this is useful when monitoring network switches
having a large number of interfaces.
