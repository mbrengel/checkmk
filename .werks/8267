Title: When SNMPv1 was used to fetch the last OIDs from devices OIDs were not fetched

When a host is being monitored via SNMPv1, inline SNMP is enabled AND one check needs
OIDs which reach the end of the OID table, the data was dropped by the SNMP engine
and never reached the check. With SNMPv2 this works without problem.

The problem is that SNMP is handled differently here between v1 and v2. We have changed
our code to equalize this situation. SNMPv1 should work as v2 now.
