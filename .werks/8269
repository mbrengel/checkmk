In some cases SNMP based check could cause exceptions like "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'".
which might be caused by an invalid/incomplete SNMP answer provided by the used NetSNMP libraries.

Check_MK is now handling this result a little more robust by dropping the single result and keeping
the other ones.
