Class: fix

The notification spooler has been changed in a few places in order to avoid
duplicate notifiations in situations with bad network connections:

LI:The time a connection has needed to build up is being output in the check
LI:When no connection is establish, logging about spool files is more quiet
LI:Heartbeat checking now considers <i>any</i> received data as heartbeat
LI:Heartbeat checking now accounts for the internal computation time
LI:Logging about duplicate acknowledgements has been repaired.

The latter two topics try to avoid heartbeat alarms in situations where a
connection is still valid.
