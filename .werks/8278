Title: RPM packages created on SLES11SP3 should now work on CentOS 6
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Class: fix
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i2
Date: 1435136498
Targetversion: future

When you create RPM packages with the agent bakery on a more modern RPM based
system for an older RPM based system then the compression algorithm in the
created RPMs would not always by compatible with older RPM versions. This
has been fixed by forcing the compression to be Gzip.
