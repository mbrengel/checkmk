Title: apache_status: Fixed wrong IPv6 URLs to query the information

Class: fix

If the information from Apache is queried by IPv6, the request was denied,
because we created a bad request. Now IPv6 addresses are surrounded by
square bracket.

Service description for IPv6 Apache status information services will change,
because the general CIDR notation will be used as new service description.

In version 1.2.8 and 1.4.0:
<ul>
 <li>Apache ::1:80 Status</li>
 <li>Apache 2001:cdba::3257:9652:443 Status</li>
</ul>

Since version 1.5.0:
<ul>
 <li>Apache [::1]:80 Status</li>
 <li>Apache [2001:cdba::3257:9652]:443 Status</li>
</ul>

If historic information should not be lost and graphs should be continued,
then you have to follow three steps:

<ul>
 <li>Rename existing RRDs to new service description:<br>
     RRDs im Check_MK-Format: ~/var/check_mk/rrd<br>
     RRDs im alten Format (PNP): ~/var/pnp4nagios/perfdata<br>
     <br>
     Example:<br>
     mv Apache___1_80_Status.rrd Apache_[__1]_80_Status.rrd<br>
     mv Apache_2001_cdba__3257_9652_443_Status.rrd Apache_[2001_cdba__3257_9652]_443_Status.rrd
 </li>
 <li>Update apache_status plugin on monitored hosts</li>
 <li>Make a service discovery of the affected hosts</li>
</ul>
