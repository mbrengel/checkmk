Werk 8702 improved HTTP error handling with curl during agent registration process. It did not
take care about all the responses during the registration process. Now only the latest response
must be successful (HTTP 200). Other responses are login and redirect.

Affected systems have to fulfill two points:
<ul>
  <li>Agent version installed is 1.4.0b1 or newer</li>
  <li>Python requests module is not installed</li>
</ul>

Workaround to solve this problem is to install Python requests on the system.
