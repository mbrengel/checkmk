Title: Errors in WATO configuration do not prevent the core from being restarted anymore
Level: 2

Class: feature

When you had an error in your monitoring configuration like duplicate hosts
or services, missing timeperiods, invalid cluster nodes or parents or various
other situations then Check_MK could not create a valid configuration for the core
and thus you could not activate any changes.

This has been changed. All these errors are now only warnings. A working
configuration for the core is now always being created. WATO will display
the warnings in the <i>Activate Changes</i> page.
