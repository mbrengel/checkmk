Title: Automatically create backup of state file if state shrinks by more than 5% in size
Level: 2

If you do some unlucky misconfiguration (like setting disabled services for
all services instead of just a few) then you will loose the current state and
downtimes of all affected objects - even if you recreate them later again.
That is because from the point of view of the core vanished objects are
expected to be gone forever and their state is being dropped.

In such situations the CMC now automatically creates a copy <tt>state.1</tt>
of you state file before creating a new one in its place. Previous backups
are shifted to <tt>state.2</tt>, <tt>state.3</tt> and so an. Up to 30 backups
are being kept. These backup are <i>never</i> being restored automatically
at any time. If you like to get back to your old state, you can copy these
files manually:

C+:
OM:omd stop cmc
OM:cd var/check_mk/core
OM:mv state state.away
OM:cp state.1 state
OM:omd start cmc
C-:

This backup always happens if the size of the new state file is by at least 5%
smaller then the old one.

Note: The state in this file contains the current OK/WARN/CRIT, the plugin
output, the next scheduled check execution, notification, downtimes, comments
and stuff like that. It does <i>not</i> contain historic performance data
or events. But these do not get lost in the cases mentioned above.
