Title: More precise availability handling of removed and readded objects
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: reporting

Class: feature

The CMC now better detects objects that have been removed and readded later on to
the monitoring. It does this by logging messages of the type <tt>VANISHED HOST</tt>
or <tt>VANISHED SERVICE</tt> to the monitoring history file and processing these
messages when computing the availability timelines.
