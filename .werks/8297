Due to a bug while saving the state of current downtimes it could happen that removing
a downtime would not reset the host/service in the state "not in downtime". The blue
moon icon stayed at the host - even if there was no downtime left. This has been fixed.

The fix can only fix new downtimes automaticall, however. If you still have sticky
blue moons then please set and remove downtimes for those. The moon will then vanish.
