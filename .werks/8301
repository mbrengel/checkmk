Title: cmcdump: New tool for offline mirroring satellite sites into a central site
Level: 3
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Version: 1.2.7i3
Date: 1442925600
Class: feature

The CMC now has a new replication mechanism for mirroring the state
of satellite monitoring sites into a central site. This is much like
<tt>livedump</tt> for the Nagios core but is much more powerful.

In order to setup this you need to call <tt>cmcdump -C > cmc.config</tt>
on the remote site and transfer that file to the central site into
<tt>etc/check_mk/conf.d/yourfile.mk</tt>. This will dump the configuration
of all hosts and services. Afterwards activate the updated configuration
with <tt>cmk -O</tt>. You need to repeat it from time to time so that
your central site is up-to-date.

In a much shorter interval (e.g. once per minute) you call <tt>cmcdump >
cmc.state</tt> on the same remote site. This can easily be done with a cron
job. That file you also transfer to the central site via any mechanism
you like (scp, http, rsync, ...). Over there read it into the core with:

C+:
OM:unixcat < cmc.state tmp/run/live
C-:

This will update the core's complete state of all hosts and services that
are contained in the dump. The transferred state will correctly reflect the
following variables:

LI:The actual state (PEND, OK, WARN, ...)
LI:The plugin output
LI:The long (multiline) plugin output
LI:The performance data
LI:Whether the object is flapping and the current level of flappiness
LI:The time of the last check execution
LI:The time of the last state change
LI:The check execution time
LI:The check latency
LI:The number of the current check attempt
LI:Whether the current state is hard or soft
LI:Whether a problem has been acknowledged
LI:Whether the object is currently in a scheduled downtime

In the central site this will almost - but not entirely - be handled
like a check execution.  One difference is that no notifications will be
sent. But performance data is being processed graphs will be created. Also
the monitoring log is being updated and availability data can be processed.
Depending on our synchronization interval of the data transfer the latter
one might not be 100% precise however.

The tool <tt>cmcdump</tt> is in your path and can directly be executed.
Call <tt>cmcdump --help</tt> for details on how to call this tool.
