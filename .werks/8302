Title: New page for downloading the baked monitoring agent of a host
Level: 2

Component: agents

Class: feature

There is now a new page for every host where you can download it's Check_MK
agent.  This page has one link for every supported operating system (as WATO
cannot know which agent package type you need).

Note: The download of baked monitoring agents is only possible for users
with the Adminitrator role per default. This is because agent may contain
confidential data such as passwords. But if you like you can allow normal
users either downloading agents for hosts where they are a contact for or
even for all agents.
