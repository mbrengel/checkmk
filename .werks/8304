The Check_MK Enterprise Edition has now a new graphical user frontend for
displaying metrics time graphs. Instead of using pixeled PNG images it makes
use of interactive vector graphics using HTML 5. These graphs do not only
look better. They allow you to:

LI:Zoom horitontally using your mouse wheel
LI:Zoom vertically by dragging points up and down
LI:Scroll horizontally (into past and future) by dragging points left and right
LI:Resize a graph using the right bottom corner

If more than one graph is being displayed on the same HTML page then any zoom
or shift in time will be synchronzed to <b>all</b> graphs on the same page.
Also the reporting uses the new graphing engine and replaces the embedded
pixel images by real vector graphics.

A further advantage of the new system is, that in distributed setups no
reverse HTTP proxy is needed any longer.  The data is being fetched via
Livestatus (up-to-date core is neccessary).
