You can now let CMC send check metrics to more than one Carbon (Graphite)
database at the same time. By the way: InfluxDB can provide a socket that
is compatible to Carbon, so you now can have CMC send metrics to Carbon and
InfluxDB at the same time. All this is in addition to writing the data to
the RRDs needed for the Check_MK GUI, of course.
