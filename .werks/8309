The behaviour of the authorization setting <i>loose</i> for hosts has been
changed to be compatible with the behaviour Nagios has. If host authorization
is set to <i>loose</i> in the global settings of the Check_MK Micro Core, then
it is now suffient to be the contact of a host for seeing all of its service
- even if those services do have explicit <i>contacts</i> assigned. Formery
you needed to be an explicit contact if one had been set. In the case that
you just have contacts assigned to hosts nothing has changed.

The behaviour of the authorization setting <i>strict</i> has also changed.
If you are the explicit contact of service, but not of the host, then you
are allowed to see the service.

<b>Note</b>: This all has <b>no</b> impact on notifications. Nothing has
changed there.
