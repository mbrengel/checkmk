e.g. when doing "cmk -II" for a larger number of hosts, it could happen
that the process runs out of file descriptors when having a lot of SNMP
devices. This was caused by the fact that all SNMP sessions were kept
open during this bulk actions. The sessions are closed now after each
host during most common bulk actions (inventory, discovery, snmpwalk).
