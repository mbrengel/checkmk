By clicking on a graph, users can mark a specific position (time) in
their graphs.

This makes the graphs show the values of the marked time in the
legend below the graph. The values of the graphs at the current
marked time are shown in the column "pin".

The time is saved per user. When the saved time of the current pin 
is in the range of a graph, the pin is shown and the values are
displayed in the table.
