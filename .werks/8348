It is possible to include custom files with the agent bakery for deploying the files
with the agent. This is currently only available for windows systems.

Changes to these files were not detected by the agent bakery. The user had to modify
other rules or enforce that the agents are rebuilt. This has been changed now. All
files included with an agent are monitored for changed contents now.
