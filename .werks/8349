Class: feature

The <tt>mrpe.cfg</tt> for linux and <tt>[mrpe]</tt> section for windows agents
can now be configured via the agent bakery using the <i>Execute MRPE checks</i>
ruleset.

The only limitation is that the executed plugins are not automatically deployed
when configuring this rule. You will have to either deploy them on your own or
use the ruleset "Deploy custom files with agent" to deploy the nagios plugins
needed for your MRPE checks with the bakery. Please note that custom files can
currently only be deployed on windows systems.
