Title: Support for new RRD format with more efficient Disk IO
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: metrics
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4

Class: feature

The Check_MK Micro Core now supports a new format when creating
RRD files. Here:

LI:RRD files are kept below the new directory <tt>~/var/check_mk/rrd</tt>.
LI:All metrics of one service are kept in one RRD

Because now all metrics of a service are stored together in one RRD less
disk blocks need to be updated when a new value is entered. This saves
Disk IO. This is possible because the RRDTool version 1.5 now supports
changing existing RRDs. That way if a check outputs new metrics these can
be added to an existing RRD.

H2:Switch to the new format

The new CMC format is not used automatically - neither for existing nor
for new sites. The default for new sites might be changed in future, though.
Switching your site to the new CMC format is done in the following steps:

1. Make a backup of your current RRDs (<tt>~/var/pnp4nagios/perfdata</tt>). You might
be tended to skip this step as the amount of data can be large. But you have
been warned.

2. Go to the ruleset <i>Configuration of RRD databases of services</i> (and
<i>hosts</i> resp.)

3. Create a rule for some (or all) hosts with the setting
<i> RRD storage format: One RRD per host/service (saves disk IO, only with CMC)</i>

4. Activate Changes -  And now your system is in a state where <b>new</b> 
RRDs will automatically be created
in the new format in <tt>~/var/check_mk/rrd</tt>.

5. In order to migrate the existing RRDs use the following command:

C+:
OM:cmk --convert-rrds -v
C-:

It is also possible to specify a list of hosts and limit the conversion
to these:

C+:
OM:cmk --convert-rrds -v server01 server02
C-:

Note: This keeps the existing RRDs present in <tt>~/var/pnp4nagios/perfdata</tt>
and needs lots of diskspace. If you low in diskspace and are bold or if you
have a backup (even better) you can directly delete the PNP format RRDs:

C+:
OM:cmk --convert-rrds --delete-rrds -v
C-:

If you decided not to delete the old RRDs in the first place you can run
the command with the option <tt>--delete-rrds</tt> at any time later.

Since all of you zigs of gigabytes of RRDs needs to be transformed this
can take a long time. The good news: you do not need a downtime on your
monitoring during this period. New RRDs are being used for storing current
data as soon as they exist so with a bit luck and good disk performance you
will not loose data points.

H2:Old PNP SINGLE format

Note: The new RRD format is almost identical with the format <tt>SINGLE</tt> that
was default in PNP4Nagios a long time ago. PNP was not able to alter the
list of metrics that a service did output - however. So whenever the list of
performance data of a check changed the graphs ended at that point of time.
There is currently no direct migration from PNP's <tt>SINGLE</tt> format
to the new CMC format. But you can go the intermediate step with
<tt>cmk --convert-rrds --split</tt>.
