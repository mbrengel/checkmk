Title: Notification spooler: handle incoming connections even in situation with large spool directories

Class: fix

In situations where a large bulk of notification came in from a slave the mknotify
would happily handle all those notifications while at the same time forgetting
to handle all the connections. They would run into timeouts that way. No the
processing of notifications is limited to 3 seconds for each turn.
