Level: 3
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4

Class: feature

The Check_MK Agent Bakery now allows for automatically updating Check_MK
Agents via HTTP/HTTPS. This is realized by a new agent plugin called
<tt>cmk-update-agent</tt>, that is currently only available for Linux,
but a Windows version will follow soon. The steps for setting up the
automatic updates is:

1. Go to the new page for the Agent Deployment. You find a new button
for this in the Agent Bakery page.

2. Fullfil all of the prerequisites that are shown on that new pages.
This involves creating agents that contain the new plugin with a
valid configuration and enabling the deployment.

3. Install the new prepared agents on the target hosts of your choice.

4. Call <tt>cmk-update-agent register</tt> on these systems in order
to register the agents for updates.

5. Don't forget to enable the agent deployment's master switch!
