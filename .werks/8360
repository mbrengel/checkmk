The recurring scheduled downtimes can now be set to appear always on the
same day of the month, e.g. always on the first of the month. Also you
can choose them to happen on each first, second, third or fourth Monday,
Tuesday, etc. Also couting from the end of the month is possible, e.g. each
last friday in the month.
