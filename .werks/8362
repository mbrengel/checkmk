Title: Improved error handling in case of upgrades/downgrades
Level: 2
Edition: cee
Component: core
Class: fix
Compatible: compat
State: unknown
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1448619009

CMC stores its current state in versioned state files, which are only
downwards-compatible. When an incompatible state file is found, we
immediately terminate the monitoring core during startup.

<ul>
<li>When the state file version is older than the current one (e.g. after
an upgrade), convert it on the fly (as previously), but keep a backup of the
previous version in "state-version-XY".</li>
<li>When the state file version is newer than the current one (e.g. after a
downgrade), emit an error message, hinting at the backup version if there is
one.</li>
</ul>
