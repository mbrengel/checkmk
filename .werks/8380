Title: Removed the CMC Rush Ahead Daemon (cmcrushd)
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: wato
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.2.7i4
Date: 1455119806
Class: fix

This daemon was meant to shorten the time needed for config changes and activating them in WATO.
But it was nearly useless and caused troubles in different situations. So we decided to drop
it completely.
