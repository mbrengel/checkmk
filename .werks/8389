To prevent issues with the graphs during view / dashlet data updates the updates
are paused for 60 seconds. If you don't modify the graph in this time, the whole
page will be reloaded and the graph is reset to it's original time and vertical
scaling.

The paused update is visualized with a large pause overlay on the top/right of
the screen. This overlay shows a countdown of seconds left until the page update
is continued by reloading the whole page.
