Up to now images could only be added as fixed page elements (useful
for logos, etc.). Now you can put an image into the normal flow of
elements. This allows you e.g. to embedd data from a third party application
by creating some automated export into an image and placing that image under
<tt>/omd/sites/mysite/local/share/check_mk/reporting/images/</tt>.
