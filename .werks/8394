With the new custom graphs you can now create performance graphs with arbitrary
metrics from arbitrary hosts and services. That way you can e.g. create a graph
for showing HTTP response times from three different servers in one graph.

The new custom graphs can be added to reports, graph collections and dashboards.

There are several paths to the graph designer:

LI:Click on the context menu of an existing graph and select <i>Add all metrics of this graph to: new custom graph</i>
LI:Go to a host or service detail, there to <i>Service Metrics</i>, use the small icon of one metric and select <i>Add this metric to custom graph...</i>
LI:Press <i>EDIT</i> in the Views, Bookmarks or Reports-Snapin and click the new button <i>Custom Graphs</i> at the top
