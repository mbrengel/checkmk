If you create a new site then per default now two rules are created that
switch to the new RRD format per default. Only one RRD file per service will
be created. This save IO operations and bandwidth.

Existing sites are not affected. You can switch to single RRDs by creating
rules in <i>Configuration of RRD databases of hosts</i> and <i>Configuration
of RRD databases of services</i> for that purpose. After that run <tt>cmk
--convert-rrds</tt> for migrating existing RRDs.
