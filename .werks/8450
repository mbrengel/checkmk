Previously, the character used to separate individual values in the
modified_attributes_list columns for hosts and services was wrong when the
output format was CSV: It defaulted to "|", but it is now ",", which is
consistent with the rest of list-valued columns. Note that the actual
characters can be changed via a "Separators:" headers, just like before.
