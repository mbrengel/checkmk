The vertical axis of the graphs is limited in it's size because it is fixed. The labels
of the vertical graph axis can be longer than the desired area is. This makes the text
not readable.

Especially the bits per second graphs, e.g. the network interface traffic, had this problem.

To fix this we changed the behaviour of these graphs to have a unified scaled unit on the
vertical axis. For example the mixed bits, kbits and mbits labels have been removed and
replaced by a single scaled unit, for example only kbits, depending on the values shown
in the graph.

The currently used scaled value is displayed at the top of the vertical axis.

This mechanism has currently only been realized for the bits per second graphs, but might
be used for others in the future too.
