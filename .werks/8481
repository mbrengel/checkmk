When embedding time series graphs into reports then it can sometimes be neccessary to
add an information about the host that graph belongs to. This is especially true for
reports that cover more than just one host. The new option is called {{Format of graph title}}
and part of the option {{Graph layout}}. This option can be set in the {{Global settings}},
in the report or one of its inherited templates and also directly in the graph itself.
