When you uninstalled a baked agent in DEB format then the directory <tt>/etc/check_mk</tt>
was deleted. This has been changed so if you have own files lying around there they will
not be touched. Instead <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent</tt> will now be correctly removed
(unless you have changed that path in your configuration).
