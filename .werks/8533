When the check of a host resulted in a timeout, it could happen that the check
helper which handled the time out was left in an unintended state making the next
check timeout too early. This could result in the check helper / core communication
being mixed up. As result one host could get the check results of another reported
which mostly lead to an error message "ignoring check result for [host] / [service]: no such service".
