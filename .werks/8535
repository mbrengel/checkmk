cmk-update-agent could fail when using HTTPs with configured CA certificates.
The error message was:

Exception: Cannot fetch deployment URL via curl: Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates

This was caused by missing links in /var/lib/check_mk_agent/cas which can be
created with "c_hash /var/lib/check_mk_agent/cas".
