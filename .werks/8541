It is a good idea to keep the service check timeout values as low as possible. All past versions
could only configure this option globally. So if you had only some services needing a higher
execution time, you had to increase this global value for all your services.

Now you can use the rule set "Service check timeout (Microcore)" to control this timeout per
service. It will override the globally configured option for all matching services.
