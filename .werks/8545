Title: Improved error handling in case of Microcore to Check_MK helper communication error
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Class: fix

In case the communication protocol between the Microcore and the Check_MK helpers leads
into an exception while the helper is reading a command from the Microcore, the helper
could become unusable in a way where it starts mixing check results of hosts.

In case of such an error the helper is now terminating itself. The Microcore will then
restart the helper afterwards.
