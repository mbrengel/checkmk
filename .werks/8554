Title: CentOS/RedHat: Don't fail building agent rpms with "brp-python-bytecompile" issue
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i2
Date: 1476104058
Class: fix

The agent bakery was unable to build agent RPM packages because of the python environment
could not be loaded properly for precompiling python files. As this is not needed for us,
we have now disabled it for the RPMs created by the agent bakery.

We were able to reproduce this issue with CentOS and RedHat 6.x but other distributions
and versions may also be affected. The current Ubuntu is not.
