The notification deamon can be used for local asynchronous delivery and is informing you
about failed notification delivery since werk #8330 and is increasing the performance of
notifications in case the delivery of notifications takes time.

So the default delivery mechanism has been changed to use the local asynchronous delivery
in the Enterprise Edition.
