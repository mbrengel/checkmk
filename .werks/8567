Title: Invertible Graphite mangling

When sending performance data to Graphite, the host/service/variable part needs
to be mangled. The result of the default mangling is more readable (it simply
replaces special characters with an underscore), but it is not invertible. This
change adds C-style mangling using the standard octal escapes ('\\ooo'), so you
can reconstruct the various parts from the data sent to Graphite.
