When the connection to Carbon/Graphite is slow and/or the kernel on the
monitoring server is very busy, it could happen that we sent a partial line
only, so the net result could look like the core is stuttering.  With this
fix, we introduce a small timeout for each write before giving up, and we
make sure to close the connection in that case.  It will be re-opened later
automatically.
