The Nagios documentation for the external command PROCESS_HOST_CHECK_RESULT
explicitly states that the return code in the commandline is already the
host state, not the result code of a check result (which was the core's
previous interpretation).  We follow Nagios now more closely and map the
return code in the commandline as follows:

   0 => UP
   1 => DOWN/UNREACHABLE   (previously this meant UP, too)
   2 => DOWN/UNREACHABLE

We still deviate a bit from Nagios, because the actual decision if a host is
DOWN or UNREACHABLE is done by the core and can't be overridden from the
outside.
