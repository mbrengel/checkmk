Livestatus queries with large regular expressions in their filters could
lead to a stack overflow and consequently to a termination of the micro
core.  To handle this in a more robust way, we set a limit on the size and
complexity of a regular expression, and bump the stack sizes of the
Livestatus threads from 64kB to 256kB.  The net result is that we can
correctly handle regular expression patters of up to roughly 2k characters,
the exact value depends on the regex features used.  For larger expressions
we return a failure status in a clean way.
