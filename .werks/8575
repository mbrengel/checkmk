Title: Fixed segfaults and incorrect Livestatus replies when history file is missing
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1479392637
Class: fix

When the history file is missing at cmc startup time, the next "GET log"
query will cause a segfault.  After the automatic restart, further similar
queries will just return an empty reply until the next log rotation,
although the core has created a history by then.
