Previously, Livestatus queries for custom_variable_names columns had to
prepend an underscore to a variable name to find a given variable.  This was
an implementation detail which should not shine through, and it was highly
inconsistent with the handling of custom_variables columns.  This has been
fixed, so no spurious underscore is needed anymore.
