Previously, some filter operator did not work for numbers or had only a special
meaning with certain columns. This has been generalized in a uniform way, so all
operators work for numbers now, too.

The operators <tt>~</tt>, <tt>=~</tt>, and <tt>~~</tt> interpret numbers as bit
sets, and have the following meaning:

<ul>
<li><tt>x ~ y</tt> means: <tt>x</tt> is a superset of <tt>y</tt></li>
<li><tt>x =~ y</tt> means: <tt>x</tt> is a subset of <tt>y</tt></li>
<li><tt>x ~~ y</tt> means: <tt>x</tt> contains at least one element of <tt>y</tt></li>
</ul>

This is consistent with the way attribute list columns work and makes the
Livestatus semantics more regular.
