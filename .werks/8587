Title: Do not longer put baked agents and agent update status into WATO snapshots

The snapshots that WATO automatically creates on {{Activate changes}} do no longer
contain the baked agents and information about the agent update status. This was
considered a bug, since a replay of a WATO snapshot would also reset the update
status. And the baked agent can be very large and produce large snapshots. This
made {{Activate changes}} quite slow in some situations.

<b>Note</b>: The WATO snapshots are considered to be <i>configuration</i>
snapshots - not a replacement for a real backup!
