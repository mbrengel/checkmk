Alert handlers to send feedback to the monitoring core. The history of the
affected host or service now gets two log entries: one for the launch of
the handler, one for the termination.

Also two identical alert handlers will not be allowed any longer to run
in parallel. This will avoid flooding processes in case of hanging handlers.
