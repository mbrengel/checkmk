Title: printer_alerts: Fix discovery when there are no alerts
Level: 1
Component: checks

Previously, the discovery would only work, when the device listed
some alerts, but not in the (hopefully more common) case that the
list of alerts was empty. This has been fixed.

Thanks to Andreas DÃ¶hler for the patch!
