Title: Reworked logging configuration of the Check_MK Microcore
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Compatible: incomp
Version: 1.4.0i3

Class: feature

The logging configuration of the Check_MK Microcore has been reworked to be
configured in a single setting. The log levels have been unified for all these
log domains.

Thes configuration options have been deprecated:

<ul>
<li><tt>cmc_log_level</tt>: Logging</li>
<li><tt>cmc_livestatus_debug</tt>: Logging of Livestatus queries</li>
<li><tt>cmc_debug_alerts</tt>: Logging of the alert processing in the core</li>
</ul>

The attribute <tt>log_level</tt> has been removed from <tt>cmc_log_cmk_helpers</tt>
which is now only used to toggle the debug mode of the Check_MK helpers.

The new option is <tt>cmc_log_levels</tt> (Logging of the core).

The incompatibility is that, if you have configured custom log leves with the
options mentioned above before, they are not effective anymore. You will have
to set the log levels again using the new option.

In most cases it should be no problem that the log levels are reset, because
they are mostly only used for a short time during debugging actions.
