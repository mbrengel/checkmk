When communicating via HTTPS with the update server, the cmk-update-agent script needs to verify
the certificates of the server. The allowed certificates are stored at <tt>/var/lib/check_mk_agent/cas</tt>.

In this directory there need to be the certificates (.pem files) and symlinks named with the "subject hashes"
of the certificates. In previous versions these symlinks were created by the <tt>c_rehash</tt> command
which is not available on all plaftforms.

We have changed that now to use the python OpenSSL bindings (if available) and fallback to the c_rehash
command only in case they are not available.
