Title: cmk-update-agent: Prevent using proxy for HTTP calls
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0b1
Date: 1482482022
Class: fix

On systems where <tt>curl</tt> is installed, the agent updater
is using this command to communicate with it's update server.

By default curl is using proxies configured via environment
variables http_proxy, https_proxy, etc.. Since the update server
is usually an internal host which is directly reachable and not
via proxy, we suppress the use of a proxy with the curl
--noproxy option.
