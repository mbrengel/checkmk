Title: Fixed crash of monitoring core with duplicate hosts
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: cmc
Compatible: compat

Class: fix

When host names were not unique, the Check_MK micro core crashed when the
"hostgroups" or "servicegroups" table was queried via Livestatus.  This has
been fixed now.

Note that such a configuration is invalid, but due to another bug (in cmk),
it was possible to generate it nevertheless.
