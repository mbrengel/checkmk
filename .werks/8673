Title: Do not swallow I/O errors when communicating to mkeventd
Level: 1

Class: fix

Previously, I/O errors caused by communicating with mkeventd were silently
swallowed by the Livestatus interface, returning just an empty result.  Now
you get an appropriate error when using the "fixed16" response header.
