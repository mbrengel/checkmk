While the requirement makes sense for the servicegroups table (there can be
multiple hosts with the same service), it is actually harmful when querying
the host table: One can't formulate queries like "give me all hosts which
don't have service FOO".
    
To keep backwards compatibility *and* enabling such queries, the "hostname|"
prefix is optional for those columns in the host table now.
