Class: fix

All host/service-related tables had some issues with various columns:

   * The columns "comments", "comments_with_info", "downtimes" and
     "downtimes_with_info" could miss some data.
    
   * The "metrics" column did not always contain a list.

The bugs only manifested for some rare edge cases, and only CMC was
affected.
