The Check_MK Micro Core did not handle persistent recurring downtimes
correctly during configuration reloads: Already existing ones were removed
and re-added, but there was a small time window where the downtime was not
actually active (between the reload and the next time all downtimes are
handled, i.e. up to 3 seconds).  This could lead to notifications during
downtimes, e.g.  when a host or service was in a non-OK state during the
reload.
