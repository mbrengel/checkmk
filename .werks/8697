Title: New report element "Multiple graphs"

Class: feature

In case you want to add graphs of a dynamic collection
of services, for example all "CPU load" graphs of all hosts
that are tagged as productive hosts, you could only create
a "view" report element, specify the filters and add a single
painter showing the graphs of the service to the view. This
was working for some cases, but produced strange layout issues
in some cases. You could also not filter the single graphs of
the servvices. It was always showing all graphs of the services.

Now you can use the "Multiple graphs" report element to select
a collection of hosts/services to show the graphs. You can
configure this element to show only the N'th graphs of the
hosts/services. And you have many options to configure the
graph rendering to fit your needs now.
