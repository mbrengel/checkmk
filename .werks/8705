Title: RPM/DEB: Verifying python version during install when shipping python plugins
Level: 1
Edition: cee
Component: agents
Compatible: compat
Version: 1.4.0i3
Date: 1487579291
Class: fix

The agent packages shipped by the agent bakery may contain agent plugins that need
a python interpreter on the target system. The Debian- and RPM-packages built by
the agent bakery are now verifying that the python interpreter is installed as
'python' in the PATH and also verify that this python is Python 2.x. The later check
is needed because the Python agent plugins are currently only Python 2.x compatible.
