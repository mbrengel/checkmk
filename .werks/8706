Title: cmk-update-agent: Interactive call now works correctly with changed config path

The agent updater needs access to the Check_MK agent configuration directory, e.g. to
read it's own config. When this directory is changed from /etc/check_mk using the
WATO ruleset "Installation paths for agent files (Linux, UNIX)", the interactive call
of the agent updater was not able to find it's configuration anymore. When the program
is installed via the bakery packed packages, the updater now knows about the custom
path and finds it's configuration correctly.
