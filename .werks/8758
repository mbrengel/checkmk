Clusteraware snmp check plugins with 'node_info' set to 'True' and
len(snmp_info) > 1 now handle node info as agent check plugins.

External check plugins with above requirements might exist. In this
case please contact the programmer of these check plugins.

Also fixed the check plugins cisco_wlc and juniper_trpz_aps_sessions
which are adapted to above handling of node info.
